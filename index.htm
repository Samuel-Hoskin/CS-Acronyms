 DSO 3: Achieve world class standards in education
 DSO 4: Close the gap in educational achievement for children from disadvantaged backgrounds
 DSO 5: Ensure that young people are participating and achieving their potential to 18 and beyond
 DSO 6: Keep children and young people on the path to success
 to drive forward the cross-government Public Service Agreements (PSAs).
 
 PSAs
 
 PSAs set a vision for continuous and accelerated improvement in the Government's priority outcomes. They are important in delivering the Children's Plan and Every Child Matters outcomes. DCSF led on five PSAs and contributed to at least a further ten. 
 
 The Department led on: 
 
 PSA 10: Raise the educational achievement of all children and young people.
 PSA 11: Narrow the gap in educational achievement between children from low income and disadvantaged backgrounds and their peers respectively. 
 PSA 12: Improve the health and wellbeing of children and young people.; Improve children and young people's safety
 PSA 13: Improve children and young people's safety
 PSA 14: Increase the number of children and young people on the path to success.
 
 The Department also had a seventh internal strategic objective to lead and manage the system.

It also assesses capacity to improve services and identifies strengths and weaknesses, and acts as a risk assessment to focus any future Joint Area Review inspection. The APA performance rating forms the children and young people's services block of the Audit Commission's annual Comprehensive Performance Assessment of Local Authorities (LA).
 
 Process
 
 Inspectors consider the Children and Young People's Plan and annual review of it, performance data and other evidence (e.g. published documents, briefings including one from the Government Office on behalf of the Department for Education, and recent school inspections). They also have a meeting with the LA. 
 
 The APA letter to each LA includes a score for performance and one for capacity to improve. The letter provides judgements about the council's contribution to improving Every Child Matters (ECM) outcomes for children and young people, and lists particular strengths and areas for improvement. APA 2007 letters were published by Ofsted on 26 November 2007. The performance score is passed to the Audit Commission for the Comprehensive Performance Assessment of the council (CPA for 2007-08 will be published in February 2008).
 
 APA is a key driver in the ECM improvement cycle. The judgements made in APA are used as a basis for discussion of areas that require improvement and focus by the authority in the annual priorities setting process which happens in November/December. Priorities are monitored by each authority's Children's Services Adviser throughout the year.

The APU commissioned research teams to create instruments and methods of assessment and to conduct surveys in five curriculum areas: language, science, mathematics, foreign languages and design and technology. Between 1978 and 1988 surveys were carried out in these areas using samples of children aged 11, 13 (science and foreign language only), in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
 Aims and objectives
 The APU existed to provide objective information about national standards of childrens performance at all levels of ability. Its terms of reference included making the findings available to those concerned with resource allocations within government departments, LEAs and schools. Hence, as well as formal reports of each survey and academic papers, its outcomes included a series of short booklets for teachers. These provide teachers with brief accounts of what was tested in the APU surveys in science and summaries of performance in different aspects of science of students at different ages and in different sub-groups.

 Membership of the Association is now of the order of 15,000, with a broad spread of membership from primary and secondary teachers, to technicians, those involved in Initial Teacher Education, and also includes some 2500 student members. The Annual Conference now attracts in excess of 3500 people and ASE has an enviable reputation worldwide. 
 ASE is a publisher; as well as its main journals, Education in Science, Primary Science Review, School Science Review and Science Teacher Education, ASE publishes about 10 new titles a year. A full listing of current publications is on their website.

 There are over 4,000 AUA members nationally and internationally based in universities and higher education colleges as well as HE related bodies such as Universities UK and the funding councils. There are also growing numbers of members in further education institutions. 
 
 AUA is committed to raising the profile of the profession and developing best practice and the highest standards of professionalism in higher education management and administration. AUA's code of professional standards, endorsed by the Association of Heads of University Administration (AHUA) and a growing number of institutions, provides the framework of core values and principles to underpin the profession of university administration.
 
 Professional development 
 
 AUA is an established provider of professional development opportunities for university managers and administrators in the higher education sector. Their aim is to help members to identify their own professional development needs. They also provide opportunities to meet these needs through their information services, events and conferences and, for those who prefer, a recognised qualification - the Postgraduate Certificate. 
 
 AUA organises an annual programme of seminars, workshops and conferences. The Annual Conference is the largest professional development conference in the HE calendar, with around 130 sessions and keynote presentations. 
 
 The AUA Postgraduate Certificate in Professional Practice is a portfolio-based scheme validated by the Open University. Achievement of the Award demonstrates a knowledge of key areas within the HE sector, transferable skills and evidence of the 'professional journey' undertaken.

 Additional information from The Knowledge accessed 2019-04-02
 The Community Champions fund (CCF) was set up by the Department for Education and Employment in 2000, following a request by David Blunkett, the then Secretary of State for Education, to help people to inspire others to get more involved in renewing their neighbourhoods through participation in community activities.
 
 CCF was a 3 million (per year) programme which offered individuals up to 2000 to run innovative projects in their community to change it for the better. It had funding until March 2008.
 
 Objectives of CCF 
 
 The main objectives were to:
 
 increase the skill levels of individuals to enable them to act as inspirational figures, community entrepreneurs, community mentors and community leaders
 increase the involvement of communities in regeneration and learning activity.
 
 Administration
 CCF was delivered through the nine Government Offices (GOs) in England. Each GO was allocated a budget according to the numbers of long term unemployed (6 months or more) 18 to 65 year olds in the region. The GOs delivered the fund through locally contracted intermediary organisations. Up to 15 per cent of the allocated budget could be spent on management fee to administer the fund. The intermediary organisations promoted the programme, supported and received applications, in conjunction with the GOs undertook selection, and administrated accounts for individual payments.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">CCH</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Customer Care Helpline</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">CCIO</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Chief Clinical Information Officer</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">NHSx</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Org Wide</td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">CCMS</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Customer Conversion Management Service</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">CCN</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">County Councils Network</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-04-02</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">CCoT</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Chartered College of Teaching</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">An independent chartered organisation for the teaching profession.

Funding for the CDF has been included in allocation statements for 2018 to 2019 academic year, as has the number of funded students and the minimum number of placements to be delivered by the end of the year.
 CDF is to facilitate the build-up of capacity and capability to deliver substantial industry placements and deliver such placements from the 2018 to 2019 academic year. The placements being delivered are for students on vocational and technical study programmes at level 2 and level 3. It is recognised that the delivery of significant numbers of industry placements as part of T Levels is a significant step change for the sector. This is why this funding has been provided now to help build capacity ahead of the roll out of T Levels, from 2020, which industry placements will be a compulsory part of.

 A Career Development Loan (CDL) was designed to help people gain the experience, training and qualifications they needed to improve their job skills or launch a new career. They were introduced in 1988 across Great Britain. A CDL could be used to fund a variety of vocational (work-related) courses with a wide range of organisations. 
 
 A CDL could be taken out by people whether they were employed, self-employed or unemployed. CDLs were available through an arrangement between the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) and three high street banks (Barclays, The Co-operative Bank and The Royal Bank of Scotland). Loans could be anything between 300 and 8,000 for up to two years of learning (or up to three years if the course includes one year of relevant practical work experience). The LSC paid the interest on the loan while the person was learning and for up to one month after training; the loan was then repaid to the bank over an agreed period at a fixed rate of interest. 
 
 There were three areas that a CDL could cover: 
 
 -course fees - 80 per cent of course fees, or 100 per cent if the applicant had been out of work for three months or more at the time of application 
 -other course costs - including, books, equipment, tools, childcare, travel expenses and any costs associated with disability

 The Centre for Excellence in Leadership (CEL) was launched in October 2003 as a key national agency in delivering the objectives of Success for All and is funded primarily by BIS. CEL merged with Quality Improvement Agency on 1st October 2008.
 The CEL was based at Lancaster University Management School and drew together expertise from three leading institutions. Its work involved developing the calibre and diversity of the leadership talent pool within the learning and skills sector and contributing to the Government's vision to position UK leadership as world class by 2010. 
 For example, in 2005 the CEL launched a positive action programme for junior managers from black and minority ethnic communities called First Steps to Leadership. The Routes to Success Programme, also launched in 2005, aimed to fast-track promising candidates in middle management roles to increase the pool of senior management professionals.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">CEM</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Centre for Education Management</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-04-11</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">CEO</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Chief Executive Officer</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Not Limted to CS</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">CEO (education)</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Chief Education Officer</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-05-30</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">CEO (executive)</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Chief Executive Officer</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-05-30</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">CEOP</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), formed in April 2006, is a cross agency and cross business department of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, which is tasked to work both nationally and internationally to bring online child sex offenders, including those involved in the production, distribution and viewing of child pornography to the UK courts.
 
 CEOP is dedicated to protecting children from sexual abuse wherever they may be. That means building intelligence around the risks, tracking and bringing offenders to account either directly or with local and international forces and working with children and parents to deliver their unique ThinkuKnow educational programme. 
 
 Working across the UK and maximising international links, CEOP delivers what is termed a "holistic" approach that combines police powers with the dedicated expertise of business sectors, government, specialist charities and other interested organisations all focused on tackling child sex abuse.

 HEFCE Initiative 
 
 The CETLs initiative arose from a consultation held by HEFCE in 2003 and there are 74 in existence. The funds received by CETLs will be used to recognise and reward excellent teachers and enable institutions to invest in staff, buildings and equipment to support and enhance successful learning in new and challenging ways.
 
 Funding 
 
 Funding of CETLs will total 315 million over five years from 2005-06 to 2009-10. Each CETL will receive recurrent funding, ranging from 200,000 to 500,000 per annum for five years, and a capital sum ranging from 0.8 million to 2 million. This initiative represents HEFCE's largest ever single funding initiative in teaching and learning.

 History and accomplishments
 
 The Campaign for Learning started life in 1995 following the publication of the Kennedy Report as an RSA (the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufacturers and Commerce) initiative and became an independent charity in November 1997. In 1999 it coordinated the first Learning at Work Day as part of Adult Learners' Week and in 2007 it launched the National Workplace Learning Network.

 Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) standardises, simplifies and streamlines the reporting of school finances in all maintained schools in England. The CFR data has been used to populate a website with a bank of benchmarked data, giving all maintained schools the opportunity to compare their incomes and expenditures with those of similar schools. In addition, the CFR data is being used to populate part of the Section 52 Outturn Statements and for analytical work in the Department.
 CFR increases the level of accountability of school managers whilst prompting schools to become more self-managing. The ideology that each school is in the position to make the best decisions about allocating resources is at the core of CFR. Access to benchmarked data will allow school managers to make better-informed decisions when deciding annual budgets, thus improving overall efficiency year on year. CFR will facilitate networking between schools and encourage 'learning by looking': less efficient schools will be expected to look to more successful schools for advice on best practice.
 The approved headings for the CFR framework came into force on 1 April 2003 in preparation for the first full data collection exercise. The data is collected from all schools via Local Authorities using software supplied by the Department.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">CG-MIC</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Cell & Gene - Manufacturing and Innovation Centre</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Project to convert an animal vaccine facility to manufacture human vaccines</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">BEIS</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">UK Vaccines Taskforce</td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">CGFS</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Curriculum Guidance for the Foundation Stage</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-05-29</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">CGLI</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">City and Guilds of London Institute</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-05-29</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">CGMP</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Current good manufacturing practices</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">US regulations use the phrase "current good manufacturing practices"</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">BEIS</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">UK Vaccines Taskforce</td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">CGTC</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">A centre of excellence in innovation, supported by Innovate UK</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">BEIS</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">UK Vaccines Taskforce</td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">CHB</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Child Benefit</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DWP</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">CHE (Chronicle)</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Chronicle of Higher Education</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-05-29</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">CHE (college)</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">College of Higher Education</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-05-29</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">CHE (community home)</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Community Home with Education on the Premises</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-05-29</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">CHEG</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">CHECK HOW TO EXPORT GOODS</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DIT</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">CHERI</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Centre for Higher Education Research and Information</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-05-08</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">CHI</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Children of High Intelligence [support society for]</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">CHI stands for 'The Support Society for Children of High Intelligence' and is a support organisation for the benefit of the young and intellectually gifted.

 It allows public, private and voluntary sector organisations to pledge support, including:
 apprenticeships

 All support given through CLC will help care leavers to make a transition to independence. This ranges from CV training to accommodation for care leavers in higher education.
 Every care leaver has a personal adviser who can provide information on CLC offers.

They are located mainly on secondary school sites and provide state of the art information and communication technology-based learning opportunities across the curriculum for pupils and teachers at a network of local schools and for the wider community.
 The first CLC opened in October 2000. There are currently [date unknown] 105 Centres operating in EIC areas around the country.
 All EiC partnerships have at least one CLC. The aim of CLCs is to enhance teaching and learning across the whole curriculum for pupils and teachers in our major cities, particularly in secondary schools, and to provide access to education to the wider community. Their aim should also be to provide additionality to what is already available in an area.
 CLCs are a shared resource for the host school and all the other schools in the CLC partnership, although legal ownership will usually lies with the Local Authority or the host school. This is usually achieved by establishing a management board including representatives from some or all of the partnership schools, and often from local primary schools and the wider community as well.

Children missing education refers to all children of compulsory school age who are not on a school roll and who are not receiving a suitable education otherwise (e.g. at home, privately, or in alternative provision). The new duty complements and reinforces duties that already exist for schools to monitor (http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/schoolattendance attendance) and it is important that local authorities work with schools to make sure they do it effectively. Schools already have a duty to monitor attendance through the daily attendance register and to make returns to LAs where the attendance of individual pupils gives cause for concern.

These programmes are focused on delivering vocational skills that meet particular sector and industry needs through the development and delivery of high quality, specialist training across a range of sectors. 
 
 CoVE Network
 
 The CoVE Network of around 400 approved centres was completed in January 2006, but the programme continues to evolve to meet changing circumstances and priorities in the world of vocational training. 
 
 CoVE Specialist Development Groups
 
 The Centres of Vocational Excellence (CoVE) Specialist Development Groups (SDGs) support best practice. They aim to ensure that all CoVEs develop their provision to meet the CoVE criteria and develop strategies to support continuous improvement in the quality of vocational education and training. CoVE SDGs are made up of groups of CoVEs and cover all CoVE specialisms, such as catering, childcare, retail and logistics. The first CoVE SDGs were set up by the Learning and Skills Development Agency in 2002 as part of the CoVE programme.

 Further information below from: The Knowledge accessed 2019-05-30
 The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) was an executive agency of the Home Office which aimed to help employers make safer recruitment decisions by identifying candidates who might have been unsuitable for certain types of work, through a service called Disclosure.
 Employers could ask successful candidates to apply to the CRB for a Standard or Enhanced Disclosure, depending on the duties of the particular position or job involved. In addition to information about a person's criminal record, Disclosures supplied in connection with work with children would contain details of whether a person was included on List 99, the Protection of Children Act List, or was disqualified by the courts from all work with children. Enhanced Disclosures might also have contained details of acquittals or other non-conviction information held on local police records, relevant to the position or post for which the person had been selected.
 The Bureau aimed to process 90% of Enhanced Disclosures within 4 weeks and 90% of Standard Disclosures within 2 weeks of receipt of a correctly completed application.

 Areas of research
 
 National Tests and Task development for England
 
 Cripsat was one of three agencies contracted to develop national tests for England for 2003-2006. Their role was to develop assessment of scientific enquiry in the national tests at the end of Key Stage 2 (age 11 years) and Key stage 3 (age 14 years). 
 Non-statutory assessment and curriculum materials for Wales
 Cripsat is the agency contracted to ACCAC (Qualifications, Curriculum and Assessment Authority for Wales) to develop the non-statutory Key Stage 2 science tests for 2006 and the Key Stage 2 Optional Assessment Material in science for 2007. Scientific Enquiry materials for Key Stage 2 are also being developed as part of ACCAC's on-going programme to commission Welsh Language and Bilingual Classroom Materials.

 There are currently a number of definitions of child sexual exploitation in use by voluntary organisations and agencies. This has led to some confusion and additional challenges for practitioners working with children and families, creating inconsistencies in risk assessment and data collection. 
 The government aims to provide clarity so all professionals are using the same definition of child sexual exploitation in their work to prevent abuse and investigate offending. 
 The proposed definition is:
 Child sexual exploitation is a form of child abuse. It occurs where anyone under the age of 18 is persuaded, coerced or forced into sexual activity in exchange for, amongst other things, money, drugs/alcohol, gifts, affection or status. Consent is irrelevant, even where a child may believe they are voluntarily engaging in sexual activity with the person who is exploiting them. Child sexual exploitation does not always involve physical contact and may occur online.

 If a child has committed an offence or broken a Local Child Curfew, they can be placed under the supervision of a youth offending team. This is called a Child Safety Order.
 The order normally lasts for up to 3 months, but in some cases it can last for up to 12 months.
 If a child doesnt stick to the rules of an order, the court can consider if the child should be taken into care.

The first wave of pilots began in September 2008 in 10 local authorities, with best practice subsequently being rolled out more widely.
 
 The local authorities in the first wave of pilots were:
 
 Northumberland (North East Region)
 Sefton (North West Region)
 Bradford (Yorkshire & Humber Region)
 Nottinghamshire (East Midlands Region)
 Solihull (West Midlands Region)
 Luton (Eastern England Region)
 Barking & Dagenham (London Region)
 Camden (London Region)
 Oxfordshire (South East Region)
 Cornwall (South West Region) 
 
 In 2010-11 funding was provided to every LA to allow them to focus on one or more areas of improvement, depending on their local needs and priorities:
 Better data: estimating demand and monitoring take up
 Participation and feedback: consulting with families
 Improving information for families
 Supporting families to make choices
 Workforce development
 Increasing capacity, inclusion and improving quality
 Meeting particular childcare needs
 Affordability and cost.

It was led at time of closure by the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Amber Rudd MP.[2] Following Theresa May's appointment as Prime Minister in July 2016, the department was disbanded and merged with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, to form the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy under Greg Clark MP.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">DEDS</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Data Exchange Data Store</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Part of Data Collections and Funding System (DCFS) application set</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">Defra</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">DEI</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Data Engineering Integration</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">DEL (expenditure)</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Departmental Expenditure Limit</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">In Spending Reviews, firm Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL) plans are set for departments for three years. To ensure consistency with the Government's fiscal rules departments are set separate resource (current) and capital budgets. The resource budget contains a separate control total for near cash expenditure, which is expenditure such as pay and current grants which impacts directly on the measure of the golden rule.
 To encourage departments to plan over the medium term departments may carry forward unspent DEL provision from one year into the next and, subject to the normal tests for tautness and realism of plans, may be drawn down in future years. This end-year flexibility also removes any incentive for departments to use up their provision as the year end approaches with less regard to value for money. For the full benefits of this flexibility and of three year plans to feed through into improved public service delivery, end-year flexibility and three year budgets should be cascaded from departments to executive agencies and other budget holders.
 Three year budgets and end-year flexibility give those managing public services the stability to plan their operations on a sensible time scale. Further, the system means that departments cannot seek to bid up funds each year (before 1997, three year plans were set and reviewed in annual Public Expenditure Surveys). So the credibility of medium-term plans has been enhanced at both central and departmental level.
 Departments have certainty over the budgetary allocation over the medium term and these multi-year DEL plans are strictly enforced. Departments are expected to prioritise competing pressures and fund these within their overall annual limits, as set in Spending Reviews. So the DEL system provides a strong incentive to control costs and maximise value for money.
 There is a small centrally held DEL Reserve. Support from the Reserve is available only for genuinely unforeseeable contingencies which departments cannot be expected to manage within their DEL.

 DEFINITION
 1. Demand led funding (DLF) is a new funding model, reflecting the principle that learner (or employer) demand and choice should directly affect the amount of funding earned by providers.
 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 2. Under the DLF model, providers earn money based on actual delivery. Following the tendering process, approved providers will agree an allocation value with the LSC prior to the start of the year. However, the provider's actual budget will depend on learner demand, as the reconciliation arrangements will recover funding from those providers that fail to deliver their agreed allocations.
 3. Demand Led Funding is split into three models:

Each zone was initially established for a period of 3 years with the possibility of being extended for 2 further years. In return for setting a range of challenging targets for improvement each zone receives up to 1 million per annum in Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) grant and in contributions from business or other partners.
 In EAZs, school governors, parents, Local Authorities, businesses and members of the wider community can all play an active part in developing and implementing zone programmes, and in monitoring their progress. One of the key ways of doing this is through membership of the Action Forum.

DfES allocated 25 million for education business link activity in 2006-2007. They are also known as School Business Links (SBL).
 From April 2001 the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) assumed responsibility for ensuring the provision of education business link activity. To meet this responsibility, EBL consortia were formed in each of the 47 LSC areas. These consortia aim to provide a single face to both schools and businesses and to deliver a full range of high quality activities and a single contracting point for local LSCs.

 Every Child A Reader (ECAR) is a unique collaboration between charitable trusts, the business sector and government. It aims to show that, with the right resources, it is possible to overcome the literacy difficulties that blight so many children's lives. 
 
 The initiative is funding highly-skilled Reading Recovery teachers in inner-city schools, to provide intensive help to children most in need. The immediate aim is to reach 5,000 children, particularly those living in areas of high social deprivation. It forms part of the government's London Challenge, a partnership between all who seek more for London's young people. It eventually aims to help 30,000 children with severe literacy difficulties by 2010-11.
 
 Longer term, the initiative aims to secure sustainable investment in early literacy intervention, and to explore how intensive support in reading can be provided most cost effectively in a national context. The Department has provided the initiative with matched funding of 4.55 million over three years.
 
 ECAR resulted from recommendations made in the Rose Review which identified that 'some children...have neuro-developmental disorders and other special educational needs that may present formidable obstacles to learning to read and write...' and goes on to discuss effective approaches to support children at risk of underachievement.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">ECCTIS</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Educational and Credit Transfer Information Service</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-06-03</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">ECDL</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">European Computer Driving Licence</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">ECEC</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Early Childhood Education and Care</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">ECF</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Early Career Framework (teachers)</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Starting in autumn 2021, early career teachers undergoing induction will receive 2 years of professional development and support underpinned by the Early Career Framework (ECF).

 Education Development Plans (EDP) were key plans produced by all Local Authorities (LA) setting out its strategies for improving standards in schools and raising pupil attainment. The plans are produced in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, and submitted to the Secretary of State for approval. EDP have now been superseded by Raising Achievement Plans.
 There are three key elements to an EDP: 
 1.The LA targets for raising pupil attainment, and improving attendance at school
 2.An audit of pupil attainment in the LA area under each of the five national priorities set out in the guidance (primary; KS2; KS3; tackling underperformance; schools causing concern)
 3.A programme for school improvement and raising pupil attainment based on the local audit
 
 The second generation of EDP (for 2002-07) was approved by the Secretary of State in March 2002. A condition of approval of the EDP was that LA annually submit a report evaluating the EDP and a list of their school-improvement activities for the coming year. This material will not be required in the future, giving local authorities time to prepare the Children and Young People's Plan which they will have in place by April 2006, following the introduction of the Children and Young Persons Bill which repealed the EDP legislation.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">EDRM</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Electronic document and record management</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">EDS</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Electronic Data Systems</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">EDS</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">ECONOMIC DOMESTIC SECRETARIAT</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DIT</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">EDS (electronic)</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Electronic Data Systems</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Source: Department for Education and Employment and Office for Standards in Education., (2000).

 The Early Excellence Centres (EEC) programme was established in 1997 to develop models of good practice in integrating early education, childcare and family support services, including parental involvement and outreach work, and to provide training and a focus for dissemination. It formed part of the Governments broader strategy for raising standards, increasing opportunity, reducing social exclusion, improving health and addressing child poverty. 
 
 EECs along with other settings - like neighbourhood nurseries, maintained nursery schools, primary schools, family centres, voluntary and private sector provision formed the basis of Sure Start Children's Centre developments. They offered one-stop-shops where families and children had access to high quality, integrated care and education services delivered by multi-agency partners within one centre or a network of centres. The national evaluation of the EEC pilot programme began in September 1999 and was completed in November 2002.
 
 EECs offered high quality practice in integrated education and day care for young children, and services and opportunities for parents, carers, families and the wider community both directly and in cooperation with other providers. They were expected to demonstrate underpinning high quality practice across a broad range of education and care services for children and families.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">EEF (education)</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Education Endowment Foundation</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) is an independent grant-making charity dedicated to breaking the link between family income and educational achievement, ensuring that children from all backgrounds can fulfil their potential and make the most of their talents.

 On 1 April 2012, the Education Funding Agency (EFA) became one of four new executive agencies of the Department. It took over the functions previously carried out by Partnerships for Schools and the Young People's Learning Agency as well as the DfE.
 
 The EFA had over 700 staff based in 11 offices, as well as a number of remote workers. The chief executive was Peter Lauener.
 
 Its main function was to fund the education system for 3-19 year olds (or up to the age of 25 for disabled students). This covered pupils in academies, in local authority maintained schools and in 16-19 education and training. The EFA also supported the delivery of capital programmes for schools, academies, free schools and sixth form colleges.
 
 The EFAs principal responsibilities were:
 to distribute the Dedicated Schools Grant for the education of pupils up to age 16 in local authority maintained schools;
 to provide funding for all 16-19 education and training;
 to provide funding for learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities aged 16-24; and
 to support the delivery of capital programmes for schools, academies, Free Schools and sixth form colleges.
 
 EFA was arranged into four groups to achieve this: Academies; Young People; Capital; and Finance, performance and maintained schools.
 
 The creation of the EFA made it clear that the line of accountability for the funding of the education system is to ministers. Bringing together capital and revenue expertise into a single body provided an excellent opportunity for streamlining the funding system and making it more efficient and effective.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">EFAU (departmental organisational unit)</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Education Funding Analysis Unit</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Year(s) active (where known): 2013</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">EFG (departmental organisational unit)</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Education Funding Group</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Year(s) active (where known): 2018?</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">EFL</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">English as a Foreign Language</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">EFQM</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">European Foundation for Quality Management</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Source: Department for Education and Employment and Office for Standards in Education., (2000).

 The Equality and Human Rights Commission is Great Britains national equality body and has been awarded an A status as a National Human Rights Institution (NHRI) by the United Nations.
 Our job is to help make Britain fairer. We do this by safeguarding and enforcing the laws that protect peoples rights to fairness, dignity and respect.
 As a statutory non-departmental public body established by the Equality Act 2006, the Commission operates independently. We aim to be an expert and authoritative organisation that is a centre of excellence for evidence, analysis and equality and human rights law. We also aspire to be an essential point of contact for policy makers, public bodies and business.

 Entitlement
 Entitlement to EMA depended on the household income being 30,000 or less, assessed in the same way as Tax Credits. Students received their EMA for 2 years with a third year available for those who need additional time to achieve their full potential. EMA offered a weekly payment of up to 30, paid directly to young people, with the opportunity to receive bonuses of 100 for good progress.

 The iEOA like its predecessor remains the only independent professional organisation of its kind in the UK and abroad and will continue to lobby establishment on behalf of its community through its strong charitable ethos. But unlike its predecessor which was supported and funded by government around the supporting the exam systems in operation, the iEOA is returning to its roots that revolve around centre needs and those communities and not just around facilitating an exam system in which this community has had very little say in or influence on over the years.

 In 1997 Effective Pre-School, Primary and Secondary Education (EPPSE) was instigated as the UKs first major study to focus on the effectiveness of early years education. More than 3,000 children were assessed at the start of pre-school (at approximately three years old) and their development monitored as they entered school until they made their post-16 education, training or employment choices. Children were assessed at the start of the study and on entering school at primary ages 6, 7, 10 and 11 and secondary ages 14 and 16. A sample of children with no pre-school experience was used as a comparison to the main study.

It is an association of networks organised by areas. Each network is autonomous. 
 In October 1993, with financial support from the European Commission, a group of researchers working in the field of parents in education in different parts of Europe met in Glasgow to discuss how to increase contact across Europe, to exchange knowledge of research developments in Europe and to stimulate research about parents in education at all levels, including intercultural European research. The group decided to establish ERNAPE and to organise this research network by language areas, rather than by countries. 
 The term "parents in education" is intended to include both the relationship of parents to school systems and the contributions which parents and families make to their child's learning outside school. The field of research about parents in education and families in education is increasingly being recognised as vitally important.
 ERNAPE will be relevant to anyone researching in the areas of education, educational administration, educational psychology, educational sociology and related disciplines. ERNAPE will also be of interest to parents, teachers and their organisations. ERNAPE is an independent body, not tied to any political, religious or other ideological groups. 
 The purposes of ERNAPE are:
 information exchange between researchers and organisations; 
 interaction in doing research: 
 design of joint programmes, analysis and reflection on parents in education; 
 stimulating awareness of the field; 
 supporting/educating young researchers in the field of parents in education.

 The European Social Fund (ESF) was created under the Treaty of Rome in 1957 to improve job opportunities by promoting employment and increasing the geographical and occupational mobility of workers across the six founding Member States. They were France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Over the years ESF has experienced many changes. Social and economic evolution, the changing nature of EU policies, and enlargement have all played their part in how ESF operates today. 
 
 In England ESF has been made simpler and more flexible. There is a single ESF programme for England with just two main priorities for employment and skills. The role of regional partnerships has been strengthened and ESF targeted to address distinctive regional and local needs. ESF has seen many changes over the past 50 years, but throughout this time it has remained faithful to its original objective of improving the employment prospects of Europes citizens.

 Employer Training Pilots (ETPs) offered subsidised training to small and medium-sized enterprises to help them develop their workforces. The ETPs were launched in September 2002 by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Led by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), they encouraged employers to train low-skilled employees by refunding the cost of giving low-skilled employees paid time off work to take education and training courses. 
 
 There were three rounds of pilots, the first started in September 2002, the second in September 2003 and the third in September 2004. They targeted the most vulnerable and low-skilled sections of the workforce in hard-to-reach, small companies that would otherwise not take part in, or are unable to afford, training. As announced in the 2005 Skills Strategy, the ETPs have been superseded by the National Employers Training Programme.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">EU</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">European Union</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">EU</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">European Union</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">EU-TCA</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">EUROPEAN TRADE CO-OPERATION AGREEMENT</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DIT</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">EUA</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Emergency Use Authorisation</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">BEIS</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">UK Vaccines Taskforce</td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">EUI</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">European University Institute</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">EURES</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">European Employment Services</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Source: Department for Education and Employment and Office for Standards in Education., (1998).

 The Early Years Register (EYR) replaced the existing Ofsted registration arrangements for childcare (for children from birth to five) from September 2008. The EYR has been introduced alongside the Ofsted Childcare Register as part of the new arrangements introduced under the Childcare Act 2006. The EYR will be compulsory for most providers working with young children until the August following their fifth birthday. 
 
 Unless exempt, the following providers must be registered on the Early Years Register:
 
 maintained and independent schools directly responsible for provision for children from birth to the age of three; 
 child carers, such as childminders, day nurseries, pre-schools and private nursery schools, which provide childcare for children from birth to the 31 August following their fifth birthday.
 
 Certain categories of care are exempt from compulsory registration for example short term care such as creches. 
 
 Providers who are registered on the EYR will be required to offer care and early learning in order to meet the requirements of the Early Years Foundation Stage.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">EYSG (departmental organisational unit)</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Early Years and Schools Group</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Year(s) active (where known): 2018-</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">EYSPI</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Early Years Starting Points Indicators</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-06-06</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">EYTS</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Early years teacher status</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">EZ</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Employment Zones</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">September 1998-unknown.

 For the setting up of the FAS see the Education Act 1993. 
 The Funding Agency for Schools (FAS) was responsible for calculating and paying grants to the governing bodies of Grant Maintained Schools which were provided for under the Education Reform Act 1988. It also monitored the financial position of Grant Maintained schools. The FAS supported Grant Maintained schools on special measures or with serious weaknesses, following an adverse Ofsted inspection. Its remit was extended in its later years to include responsibility for the monitoring and regulation of Grant Maintained schools' commercial borrowing. By 1997 the FAS had shared responsibility with the Local Education Authority (LEA) for secondary provision in 49 LEAs, and for primary provision in 7 LEAs; and full responsibility for secondary provision in 3 LEAs. 
 It closed on 1 November 1999.

 This project provides a problem solving approach to care proceedings, where a team of substance misuse specialists, domestic violence experts, psychiatrists and social workers carry out an early assessment and agree an intervention plan with parents who come before the court in care proceedings. Once in proceedings, parents begin a trial for change, supported by the specialist team and with regular meetings with the judge, who reviews the progress being made as well as adjudicating in the case . The Family Drug and Alcohol Court model has been evaluated previously and found to have strong evidence of a positive effect on family reunification. As well as expanding the model to new sites, innovations of the FDAC model in existing sites will be tested to see if further improvements can be made.

 After January 1983 its name was changed to Further Education Unit and it was changed into a limited company. It commissioned and published research on curriculum. (Announced in PN 296/82.) It became part of FEDA in 1995. FEDA was renamed the Learning and Skills Development Agency in November 2000 to reflect its widened role across the learning and skills sector. LSDA's programmes, research, training and consultancy continue under the banner of the Learning and Skills Network (LSN). LSDA's policy and strategic work has developed into the Quality Improvement Agency (QIA).

 The Foundation Stage Profile is a way of summing up a child's progress and learning across the six areas of learning at the end of the foundation stage. The profile is made up of 13 scales based on the early learning goals and stepping stones set out in Curriculum guidance for the foundation stage. The Foundation Stage Profile Handbook provides guidance for practitioners on how to make assessments on the basis of their observations and knowledge of the whole child. 
 Recording attainment 
 A child's attainment on the 13 scales can be recorded in a Foundation Stage Profile booklet or the eProfile. These are optional; schools and settings may want to use their own systems. Whichever is used, there is no need for extensive collections of evidence for individual children and no need to complete more than one record.
 Using the stepping stones and early learning goals 
 The stepping stones and Early Learning Goals are used throughout the foundation stage for planning and assessing learning. The stepping stones (non-statutory) show the kind of knowledge, skills, understanding and attitudes that children are expected to need if they are to achieve the early learning goals. The early learning goals, which are statutory, establish the expectations for most children by the end of the foundation stage.
 Curriculum guidance for the foundation stage provides examples of 'what children do' that will help practitioners identify how children in their setting are progressing.
 
 Fit with Key Stage 1 
 The foundation stage areas of learning can be mapped onto the subject-based KS1 curriculum. How schools organise the curriculum in KS1 is for them to decide and there is sufficient flexibility for schools to adapt the content and pedagogy to their children's needs. The National Assessment Agency (NAA) is developing guidance for teachers on using the foundation stage profile data to plan for children's progression in Year 1.

 Example
 
 In this example the normal working week is 36 hours
 
 Three part-time workers work 18 hours per week and another three part-time workers work 12 hours per week. The headcount is therefore 6. 
 
 To calculate the FTE add up all the hours worked:
 
 (3 x 18) + (3 x 12) = 90 hours
 
 Then divide by the normal working week 
 
 The FTE is therefore 2.5

 The Fast Track Teaching programme was one of a number of reforms designed to modernise the teaching profession, announced in the 1998 Green Paper Teachers: Meeting the challenge of change shortly after the election of the Labour Government in 1997. 
 One of the main thrusts of this was to realise the full potential of the education system by attracting and motivating teachers and other staff with the use of incentives, professional development and general support. An evaluation of the Fast Track teaching programme was commissioned by the Department for Education and Skills in 2003. The evaluation spanned five years and had a longitudinal dimension in terms of revisiting key issues. Work began on this evaluation in July 2003 and the full results were due to be published in 2008.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">FtT</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">First tier Tribunal</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">FVTD</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Free Vehicle Tax Disc</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">FWA</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Family Welfare Association</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">FWAS</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Flexible Working Ambassador Schools</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">The Department for Education (DfE) is looking to recruit 8 flexible working ambassador schools across England.

 * improving the policies, practice and culture around flexible working by providing peer support for headteachers within local and other networks
 * increasing the likelihood of flexible working requests being accepted by providing support networks, and guidance directly to teachers who want to access flexible working opportunities
 * inviting school leaders and teachers to training and events to improve the perception of flexible working
 * increasing the use of DfEs support package by encouraging schools to use the materials alongside the support that flexible working ambassador schools offer

 Further information from The Knowledge accessed 2019-03-26: Background
 In 1976 the Schools Council recommended that the GCE and CSE examinations be replaced with a common system of examining at 16+. In 1977 the Department of Education and Science (DES) set up a Steering Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir James Waddell. In July 1978 it produced a report called "School Examinations". Cmnd 7281 (HMSO, 1978).
 The government accepted the recommendations for a single examination at 16+ to be called the General Certificate of Secondary Education in a White Paper called "Secondary School Examinations; a Single System at 16 Plus", Cmnd 7368 (HMSO, 1978).
 After further discussions the DES issued "Examinations at 16-plus: a statement of policy" in November 1982, which announced the future examination boards and the structure of the examinations. The starting dates were announced by Sir Keith Joseph on 20 June 1984 in a statement in the House of Commons (DES PN 101/84): courses were to begin in September 1986 with the first GCSE examinations in Summer 1988.
 Applied GCSEs
 The Secretary of State for Education and Skills announced the new GCSE initiative in June 2000. The Applied GCSEs were introduced for first teaching from September 2002 as GCSEs in vocational subjects. Applied GCSEs are designed to: 
 Introduce learners to a broad sector of industry and business
 Encourage understanding of the sector, key concepts and theories prevalent in it
 Develop capability in some skills used within it
 
 Nine titles are currently [date unknown] available: 
 Applied Art and Design; 
 Applied Business; 
 Applied ICT; 
 Engineering; 
 Health and Social Care; 
 Leisure and Tourism; 
 Manufacturing; 
 Applied Performing Arts and

It is central to raising standards and will help embed the culture of continuous quality improvement that is necessary to meet the Childcare Act 2006 duty to improve outcomes for all young children and reduce inequalities between them. It is also key to the Governments drive for a world class early years system as set out in the Children's Plan.
 
 Level of investment
 
 The GLF pot includes investment both in the supply of early years professionals through the Children's Workforce Development Council (CWDC) and support to incentivise their employment. The Childrens Plan boosted the pot available to a total of 305 million between 2008 and 2011. This pot is made up of 232m for settings via Local Authorities (LAs) and 73m for CWDC to deliver early years professionals with Early Years Professional Status (EYPS).
 
 The setting/LA element includes an additional Childrens Plan boost, which amounts to 57 million over the three-year period. This is intended to encourage faster employment of graduates in the most disadvantaged areas and, in particular, two graduates in those settings in disadvantaged areas where quality needs significant improvement. 
 
 The GLF supersedes the Transformation Fund and focuses specifically on securing graduate early years professionals. Funding to support training and continuous professional development for the wider workforce (for example, up to Level 5 and to work with children with additional needs) is included within the Outcomes, Quality and Inclusion block of the Sure Start, Early Years and Childcare Grant. These two blocks of funding should be used together effectively in order to secure a better qualified early years workforce and higher quality provision. 
 
 Requirement for graduates
 
 The GLF focuses on the PVI sector because thats where the need is the greatest. Over 80% of early years providers are private, voluntary or independent but the percentage of staff at graduate level in this sector is small only 3% of staff in full daycare settings are graduates compared with around 40% of early years staff in maintained primary schools. This is a huge disparity. The Government has therefore set a clear ambition that, by 2015, every full daycare setting should be led by a graduate, with two graduates in settings in the 30% most disadvantaged areas (also by 2015). 
 
 CWDC is helping to create the supply through developing more graduates with EYPS and supporting this with: 
 
 the provision, through its nationwide training and assessment providers, of course fees and student support packages (bursaries for unemployed students and supply cover for people already working in the sector and mentors for all students) and increased pathways to gaining EYPS to suit differing experience and qualification levels; and 
 a campaign to promote professional leadership in the early years sector similar to the TDAs campaign for school teachers.

While following a training plan that leads to Qualified Teacher Status, trainees are employed by schools as qualified or unqualified teachers and paid accordingly. The programmes have proved particularly suitable routes to qualification for mature people with financial responsibilities; for people from ethnic minority groups and for people with previous experience in schools, for example, as classroom assistants and instructors. They have also helped many schools to find suitable staff for difficult to fill posts and to train them on the job.
 
 The Graduate Teacher Programme (GTP) is open to graduates with a first degree (or equivalent) who are either aged 24 or over or successfully completed recognised teacher training overseas.
 
 The Registered Teacher Programme (RTP) is open to people who have been accepted onto a programme leading to a first degree (or equivalent qualification) and who are either aged 24 or over and have some higher education or comparable education or who have successfully completed recognised teacher training overseas. When employing an RTP trainee, schools need to work in partnership with a higher education institution, since participants must complete a degree at the same time as qualifying as a teacher. Participants in both of these programmes are required to hold mathematics, English and science standards.
 Grants of up to 4500 are paid by the Training and Development Agency to recommended bodies to help meet the training and assessment costs associated with GRTP trainees.

The original guidance was published in 1998 and revised in 2002. 
 2009 consultation
 Consultation on a second revision was published on 6 November 2009. The new guidance will: 
 help teachers and other staff to keep children safe by outlining their duties and giving helpful advice 
 help cut red tape by providing sample checklist forms to help save time 
 give teachers and others more confidence to organise trips by highlighting helpful schemes like the Quality Badge 
 highlight how employers should support their staff in the event of a child being hurt, so fears of legal action can be reduced
 It builds on the Quality Badge Scheme for providers, launched earlier in 2009, which cuts the paperwork that schools and others will need before organising visits to badged organisations and venues. Taking on board feedback from schools and local authorities, the guidance is now much shorter, condensing four documents into one, and is designed to be read as and when needed.
 The guidance also makes clear that the law protects teachers in the rare event of someone being hurt on a school trip, and reassures them that they can give their pupils exciting, educational and valuable experiences by organising activities outside the classroom.

It is dedicated to the provision of advice and practical support for families who wish to educate their children at home in preference to sending them to school. HEAS recognises that reliable information should be available for everyone.
 
 HEAS was established in 1995 by a group of experienced home educators in order to provide good quality information on both the legal and practical aspects of home education. Since then HEAS has given information to many families and also to education authorities, other professionals, academic researchers, politicians, voluntary agencies, the media and other bodies.
 
 HEAS offers information for home educators including advice about educational materials, resources, GCSE examinations, special educational needs, information technology, legal matters and curriculum design. HEAS produces a range of leaflets and the Home Education Handbook. In addition HEAS subscribers receive the quarterly HEAS Bulletin, access to the Advice Line, contacts with other subscribers and the HEAS registration card (for home educating families) which gives free or reduced rates of admission to certain museums and sites of interest.

 This included monitoring the financial health of universities and colleges, that their courses were good quality, and that everyone with the potential to enter higher education had a fair chance to do so.
 HEFCE did not provide grants or loans to individual students.

 applying for funding 
 training 
 preparation for assessment 
 assessment 
 HLTAs work under the direction of a teacher on tasks such as working with individual pupils and whole classes; planning and supporting learning activities; and guiding the work of other support staff.

In England, Wales and Northern Ireland the HND is a BTEC qualification awarded by Edexcel and in Scotland is a Higher National awarded by the Scottish Qualifications Authority. 
 
 The attainment level is roughly equivalent to second year of university, a Diploma of Higher Education but in some cases may be marginally below that of a bachelor's degree. An HND takes two years of full-time study, or one year full-time following successful completion of a Higher National Certificate; part-time study takes longer. In Scotland an HND is Level 8 on the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework and in England, Wales and Northern Ireland it is Level 5 on the National Qualifications Framework. It is quite common for those who have achieved a HND to add to their qualification by progressing to other levels such as professional qualifications, or a degree. 
 
 It is graded similar to GNVQ - modules are graded, rather than the HND award itself - Pass, Merit and Distinction, with Distinction the highest grade and Pass the lowest grade. Many universities will take students who have completed their HND onto either level 2 [2nd year] or level 3 [3rd year] of a degree course. [This is often called a 'top-up.] Usually which of these years depends on the modules taken in the HND. It also means that after three years [or four if, say, a business placement year is taken] a student could have both the HND and an honours degree if studying in a UK university excluding Scotland. Scottish Honour Degrees are normally 4 year courses, and so an extra year of study is required. 
 History
 
 The first Higher National Diplomas were announced in Board of Education Circular 1209 on 21 April 1921 in arrangement with the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. The first examinations were in 1922. HNC examining bodies were gradually replaced by the Business and Technician Education Council.

 IDACI is the Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index provided by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), released in December 2007. The index is based on Super Output Areas (SOAs) in England. Each SOA is given a rank between 1 and 32,482 where 1 is the most deprived SOA. 
 
 IDACI is a subset of the Income Deprivation Domain of the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2007 and shows the percentage of children aged under 16 in each SOA that live in families that are income deprived, i.e. they are in receipt of certain benefits and their equivalised income is below 60% of median before housing costs.

 Additional information below from The Knowledge accessed 2019-05-31
 An Individual Education Plan (IEP) builds on the curriculum that a child with learning difficulties or disabilities is following and is designed to set out the strategies being used to meet each child's identified needs.
 Pupils at School Action and School Action Plus (and those with statements) are likely to have an IEP, which sets out:
 the short-term targets set for or by the child 
 the teaching strategies to be used 
 the provision to be put in place 
 when the plan is to be reviewed 
 success and/or exit criteria 
 outcomes (to be recorded when the IEP is reviewed) 
 
 The IEP should record only that which is additional to or different from the differentiated curriculum plan, which is in place as part of provision for all children. The IEP should be crisply written and focus on 3 or 4 key targets, chosen from those relating to the key areas of communication literacy, mathematics and behaviour and social skills that meet the child's needs. The IEP should be discussed with the child wherever possible, and the parents.
 Following a review of the IEP, a child may continue at School Action, be taken off that level of intervention, or progress to School Action Plus.
 Where schools have a whole-school policy of individual planning and recording which covers all pupils, a child with SEN may not need a separate IEP since in those schools, the interventions for children at School Action, School Action Plus and with statements will be recorded as part of the class lesson plans along with a record of the child's progress and the outcomes of those interventions in the same way as for other children.
 Whatever recording system is used, it is vital that there is a record of the strategies and interventions employed and the outcomes and that this is available and understandable to parents and flexible enough to meet the needs of individual children.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">IES</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Institute for Employment Studies</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">IES is a leading independent centre for research and evidence-based consultancy.

 Bidding process 
 
 Organisations from all sectors were eligible to bid to the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) to establish an IIP. The allocation process identified twenty organisations that will receive funding of up to 650,000 for up to three years to develop an IIP. Grants will be paid by direct grant in 2008-09 and 2009-10. Organisations had until 8 August 2008 to bid. The bidding process yielded 141 Expressions of Interest by 8th August which were considered by the relevant government offices ahead of an assessment panel comprising officials from DCSF, Home Office, Youth Justice Board and two of the Government Offices. 50 bids were judged strong enough to proceed to the next stage. A cross-departmental assessment panel was convened on 30th September and bids were ranked on their ability to demonstrate evidence against six critical scoring factors:
 
 Demonstration of a fully integrated approach and clear multi agency working. 
 Approach in line with IIP guidance including intensity, key worker approach and background. Specification of target groups and outcomes.
 Balance of approach between sanctions and support.
 Evidence of relevant governance and commissioning process and timescales.
 Innovation and additionality. 
 
 The Youth Taskforce undertook a further moderation exercise which sought to ensure an appropriate geographic spread of projects as well as a proportionate number of Third Sector led projects being successful. This process has taken into account the local area profile including population, overall level of deprivation (IMD), family and household structure and key local outcome data including under 18 conception rates, NEET rates, first time entrants to criminal justice system, substance misuse, perceptions of anti-social behaviour and educational attainment.

The Standard provides a national framework for improving business performance and competitiveness through a planned approach to setting and communicating business objectives and developing people to meet these objectives. 
 
 The Standard is based on three main principles: 
 
 Plan - Develop strategies to improve the performance of the organisation 
 Do - Take action to improve the performance of the organisation 
 Review - Evaluate the impact on the performance of the organisation 
 
 These three key principles are broken down into 10 indicators, against which organisations wishing to be recognised as an Investor in People are assessed. IiP assessors go to an employer and provide a detailed and rigorous challenge against the IiP standards. Assessment is undertaken through a network of 12 regional Quality Centres (9 in England and 1 each in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). Investors in People UK was set up as a Non-Departmental Public Body in 1993 to take ownership of the Standard. 
 
 Investors in People UKs vision is to increase the productivity of the UK economy by improving the way in which organisations manage and develop their people, leading to business improvement and better public services.

 The ILT was located on York Science Park. The founding Chief Executive was Dr Paul Clark.
 Its stated aims were to:

 commission research and development in learning and teaching practices,
 stimulate innovation.
 In May 2004 the ILT merged with the Learning and Teaching Support Network (LTSN), and the TQEF National Co-ordination Team (NCT) to form the Higher Education Academy.

 Important IMS principles include:
 minimising demands on schools
 collecting only essential information
 collecting information once and using it many times
 storing and transferring information electronically
 automating information collection; one-button solutions
 improving the value of information returned to schools
 achieving compatibility between systems from different suppliers (interoperability)
 improving and maintaining ICT infrastructure
 setting high standards for training and technical support 
 
 Benefits for schools 
 Using management information effectively benefits schools through strengthening the management of learning, minimising non-teaching tasks and maximising the benefits of information and data stored on computer. Management and learning decisions will be much more sound, credible and resistant to challenge if they are based on reliable and relevant information. The effective use of management ICT will save time for some routine tasks, speed-up the transfer of information as children move between schools and improve the quality of information made available to, for example, parents.
 Guidance 
 Guidance on what schools need to do to benefit from the extension of electronic education management and transfer of pupil and other school management information was sent to all schools on 12 February 2001. 
 Two guide booklets have also been produced for schools, one covering the benefits to be gained from using electronic management information, the other giving assistance to those needing help in assessing and gaining competence in this area. 
 Effective management system 
 Information needs to be timely, easily and instantly accessible and in a coherent and comprehensive format. Collecting, processing and analysing information (especially from several sources) can take a good deal of time and effort. It makes sense to ensure that the people involved are competent and confident to undertake their roles. Using the tools and techniques available, particularly ICT, makes life easier. An effective management information system makes providing information for others such as DCSF and the LA faster and simpler. Management ICT is an area covered during Ofsted inspections.
 Pupil Level Annual School Census (PLASC) 
 A key part of the IMS is the construction of a Common Basic Data Set of pupil, workforce, school, and LA level information a significant step towards closely defining essential information, collecting it once only and allowing it to be used many times. It will improve the value of data by getting beyond the current aggregates and snapshots. Developments include:
 a national system of unique pupil numbers to enable information relating to the same pupil but reported at different times to be linked to create profiles of pupils and their progress
 the electronic collection of PLASC.
 The PLASC arrangements were piloted in January 2001 and have been carried out live in all maintained schools since January 2002. 
 Common standards for transferring data 
 The Common Basic Data Set (CBDS) also provides the basis for establishing standards for transferring data between sites and between different suppliers' systems (interoperability). An interoperability agreement is in place covering all the significant suppliers of management information systems to schools, based on a common XML format.
 Software systems have been compliant with the CBDS definitions needed for pupil transfer since 2001. This means that all items of the current specification for the CBDS can be transferred electronically, including the information in the common transfer file.

It was established to provide support for teachers and others working with students with special educational needs in both mainstream and special school settings.
 
 Through the development of a communications network (with some of it based on the Internet) the sharing of resources for supporting this area of education has been encouraged. The expertise, connections and membership of the two leading organisations have enabled this project to effectively progress. A website is part of the final project which received support from the Department for Education and Skills SEN Small Programmes Fund.
 
 A CD-ROM of supportive teaching resources from the project was launched in January 2003. This was circulated to mainstream secondary schools and made available to special schools with the Science Enhancement Programme (SEP) supporting its reproduction and distribution. The outcomes are intended to be of practical use to the teacher in the classroom.

The Initial Teaching Alphabet is based on the phonemic (sound) system of English and uses the Roman alphabet, augmented by 14 additional characters, to represent each distinct sound with a separate symbol. It evolved from the phonotypy of Sir Isaac Pitman (grandfather of Sir James) and the Nue Speling of the Simplified Spelling Society of Great Britain. The Initial Teaching Alphabet adheres closely to traditional orthography but contains lowercase characters only; it retains certain conventions of English spelling, such as c and k to represent the same sound and double consonants. The Initial Teaching Alphabet was adopted on an experimental basis in some schools in England (beginning in 1960) and in the United States (beginning in 1963).

 Industrial Training Boards were first established following the Industrial Training Act (1964) to cover 26 sectors of industry. They represented positive intervention by the Government after it became clear that voluntary training effort by employers would not be sufficient to avoid recurring skill shortages. A succession of reviews in the 1980s/90s found that many ITBs had not made sufficient impact to justify their continuance and most Boards were wound up. 
 
 However, the construction and engineering construction industries felt that because they employed a highly mobile labour force with extensive use of labour-only subcontractors voluntary arrangements would not work. They argued strongly to retain statutory powers for the collective funding of training from which all employers would benefit. These special circumstances were recognised by the Government and it agreed to retain the CITB and the engineering construction part of the Engineering ITB (EITB). The EITB was subsequently re-named the ECITB to reflect its reduced scope.

JARs drew together a range of evidence and inspection findings, to assess how services taken together contribute to improving the well-being of children and young people in a local authority area. 
 
 Ending of JARs
 The Local Government White Paper indicated that rolling programmes of inspections such as joint area reviews would not continue beyond March 2009 with the only rolling programme agreed from April 2009 being services for children in care. Inspections from then on will be risk-based. The Audit Commission with other inspectorates including Ofsted developed new arrangements for inspections - Comprehensive Area Assessment.

 Local Area Agreements (LAAs) are currently voluntary, three-year agreements between central government and Local Authorities and their partners, which deliver national outcomes in a way that reflects local priorities.
 
 LAAs are currently organised around four separately funded and negotiated blocks:
 
 Children and young people
 Safer and stronger communities
 Healthier communities and older people
 Economic development and enterprise 
 
 LAAs are now operating in all bar one of the top tier local authorities in England.
 
 New Local Area Agreements
 
 From April 2008, LAAs began to change. The Department for Children, Schools and Families started working with the Department for Communities and Local Government and other government departments to develop and prepare for new-style LAAs, as outlined in the 2006 local government white paper 'Strong and Prosperous Communities'.
 
 LAAs will become statutory from 2008-09 onwards. They will be at the centre of a new performance framework for local government, becoming the key delivery contract between central government, local authorities, and their partners.
 
 LAAs, children's trusts and the Children and Young People's Plan
 
 The local Children's Trust oversees the strategic coordination and overarching strategy for improving the five Every Child Matters outcomes for children, young people and their families. The children's trust therefore plays an important role in feeding into the development of the current children and young people's block of LAAs.
 
 Children's Trusts will continue to have a vital role in coordinating the work of local partnerships. They will drive the process of identifying improvement priorities for the children and young people's theme of new LAAs, and feeding these into the wider Local Strategic Partnerships which will negotiate improvement targets with central government, through Government Offices.
 
 The Children and Young People's Plan (CYPP) will provide a key basis of discussion on the children and young people's theme. The LAA will inform the CYPP and vice versa, with the LAA containing the priorities and associated targets, and the CYPP setting the strategic context for the authority's targets and the strategies for achieving them.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">LAAN</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Local apprenticeship ambassador networks</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">The national apprenticeship ambassador network is also supported by local apprenticeship ambassador networks (LAAN) throughout England.

The rapid expansion of the Learning City Network shows that the approach is working and that it offers real potential. 
 In the UK about 20 communities have been inspired by the possibilities inherent in the idea of the Learning City and have not only called themselves Learning Cities/Learning Towns, but have made development of Lifelong Learning a key part of the strategy for the development of their community. The size and nature of the places involved varies widely from Liverpool, Sheffield and Hull to Swansea, Norwich and Retford. Although the particular patterns in each place are different, each being appropriate to the particular needs of their own locality, learning Communities have a number of common agendas:
 Strategies for improving access to learning.
 An education and training strategy related to the local economy.
 Links between learning and community participation.
 Co-ordination of adult - learning institutions
 Links between education sectors.
 Learning City Toolkit
 The Learning City Toolkit is a guide that contains practical information on how to develop the Learning City 'approach'. It is structured around three strands of development, which were identified in the research work, namely:
 Partnership
 Participation
 Performance
 
 Following the guidance under each of these strands will enable practitioners to build on their present position - whatever that may be. Each strand is discussed under three levels of learning - from getting organised through to reflecting on what has been achieved and measuring the gains. The guide contains essential information for all the stages from pre-start through to consolidation and growth:
 it provides useful background on getting started and who to involve
 it highlights workable strategies and ideas - and notes possible pitfalls
 it enables learning from examples of effective practices
 examines ways of assessing progress and value
 it enables achievements to be compared and benchmarked.

 Introduced in 1990, Local Management of Schools (LMS) altered the way schools in Northern Ireland were funded and managed by giving the various Boards of Governors and School Principles the autonomy to make decisions on the allocation of resources and priorities.
 Education and Library Boards (there are five in total) are similar to Local Authorities in England and Wales; and they are allowed under LMS to allocate recurrent resources as are the Department for Education.

 Managing Information Across Partners (MIAP) is about streamlining how information on learning and achievement is collected, handled and shared across the education sector so that excellent services are made available to individuals, employers and communities. Delivery of the MIAP programme was handed over by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) to the Learning and Skills Council in December 2005, although the strategic lead was retained by DfES (now BIS).
 
 Background
 
 In 2002, 17 organisations attended the inaugural MIAP meeting where the programme of work to map the data and management issues across the post-16 sector and to identify options for improvement was initiated. Since then, the number of partner organisations involved in MIAP has grown to more than 40 and the issues and proposals for improvement have been defined through a series of feasibility studies and consultations and agreed by Ministers. 
 Original Proposals
 
 The original proposals identified the need to: 
 
 Introduce common data definitions to be used and shared by all organisations across the sector 
 Introduce a Unique Learner Number for everyone in education and training, accessed through a web based Learner Registration Service 
 Establish a mechanism for enabling learners to create their own records of participation and achievement, which they can share with advisers, providers and potential employers 
 Create a UK Register of Learning Providers 
 
 Progress
 
 Significant progress has been made as the programme moves towards its delivery phase. 
 
 A data sharing framework was agreed by all MIAP partner organisations in Autumn 2004 
 The UK Register of Learning Providers was launched in August 2005 and now contains more than 12,000 provider records 
 Common Data Definitions are being introduced in two phases during 2006 and have already been adopted by the Higher Education Statistics Agency in 20 fields 
 Cross sector tests and trials of the Learner Registration Service and Unique Learner Number began in June 2006 
 A student from Lewisham College, London, was the first person to be registered with a Unique Learner Number on September 6th 2006. By November, more than 3,200 learners had been registered 
 There are currently 74 users of the prototype Learner Registration Service in schools; colleges; Awarding Bodies, unitary and vocational; and partnerships 
 An invitation to tender was issued on October 26th 2006 to three potential suppliers short listed to design, build and run the MIAP service. A preferred bidder was announced at the end of December (LogicaCMG) and a five year contract was awarded in February 2007 
 
 MIAP has introduced a business change strand to ensure effective stakeholder engagement, drawing on existing communications and stakeholder engagement mechanisms. The aim is to ensure that all the benefits of MIAP can be realised across the education and skills sector. MIAP then planned to: 
 
 Introduce a full Learner Registration Service by summer 2007 
 Introduce a Learner Record Access prototype by summer 2007 
 Introduce full Learner Record Access by summer 2008

 Introduction
 The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) was a BIS-sponsored NDPB, established under the Learning and Skills Act 2000. This followed the white paper called "Learning to Succeed", TSO, 1999. Cm 4392. 
 It became fully operational in April 2001 when sponsored by the Department for Education and Skills, replacing the Further Education Funding Council and the 72 training and enterprise councils. Its function was to plan and fund post-16 learning in England, including: Further Education, work-based training, and adult and community learning. It had a national office in Coventry and 47 local offices, known as local learning and skills councils. It was dissolved in 2010 (see below).
 Nationally and locally, the councils were business-led, with 40 per cent of board members, the national chair and the majority of local chairs being drawn from the commercial sector.
 The LSC's top priorities included increasing adult skills and employer engagement in workforce development; and raising the quality of learning provision.
 Young people 
 Prior to the break up of the Department for Education and Skills (DfES), the LSC was responsible for funding learning provision for 16-19-year-olds up to levels 2 and 3 (level 2 equals five GCSEs at grades A-C, an NVQ level 2, an intermediate GNVQ or the equivalent. Level 3 equals two A Levels, an NVQ Level 3, an Advanced GNVQ or the equivalent). 
 It was also helping to deliver the 14-19 reforms announced in January 03, including funding around 40,000 part time vocational placements for 14-16 year olds, and working with schools and employers to organise structured workplace visits. With the formation of the Department for Children, Schools and Families, this work was transferred from the LSC to the Department.
 Adult learning and workforce development 
 The LSC had a statutory duty to increase demand for learning amongst adults, and to drive up skill levels in the workforce. Much of its work was concerned with implementing the Government's National Skills Strategy, including implementing the new entitlement to a first level 2 qualification, and developing options for a new employer training programme. The LSC was also responsible for improving basic literacy and numeracy skills, and for funding adult and community learning projects.
 Key targets on which the LSC had a leading role were:
 by 2010, 90 per cent of young people by the age of 22 will have participated in a full-time programme fitting them for entry into higher education or skilled employment
 by 2004, increase by 3 percentage points the number of 19 year olds achieving a qualification equivalent to NVQ level 2 compared to 2002; with a further increase of 3 percentage points by 2006
 increase the proportion of 19-year-olds achieving a level 3 qualification to 55% in 2004
 a quarter of young people to start an MA before age 22 by 2004 
 To improve the literacy and numeracy skills of 1.5 million adults and young people by 2007, in partnership with the Prison Service and Jobcentre Plus
 To reduce by at least 40 per cent the number of adults without a level 2 qualification by 2010
 Raising standards 
 The LSC was responsible for raising standards in teaching and learning; and for ensuring equality of opportunity for all. It played a key role in delivering the Government's Success for All strategy announced in November 2002, and implemented its own provider review process to complement the Adult Learning Inspectorate (ALI)/Ofsted inspection regime. It also led on action following area wide inspections; and led the work to establish Centres of Vocational Excellence (CoVEs); in general FE colleges and private training providers.
 Key facts about the LSC 
 The LSC had a national council which met once a month and played a strong leadership role in steering the whole organisation, so that it meets nationally agreed priorities. It consisted of 16 members, drawn from a wide range of backgrounds, including business, FE, HE, schools, the media, and the voluntary sector. The LSC was also advised by two statutory committees: the Adult Learning Committee and the Young People's Learning Committee.
 Each of the 47 local LSCs also had a chair, an executive director and a local council; and was responsible for an average budget of around 100 million, and for the education and training of over 100,000 learners.
 Dissolution of the LSC
 The Queen's Speech on 3 December 2008 announced proposed changes which meant the dissolution of the LSC by 2010. A new Skills Funding Agency took responsibility for funding of Post-19 education, and facilitating the development of Train to Gain, the new Careers Service and the National Apprenticeship Service. Responsibility for planning and commissioning 16-19 education and training passed to Local Authorities, with a small national body the Young People's Learning Agency - retained to support local authorities and ensure coherence where pupils are travelling across local authority boundaries.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">LSCB</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Local Safeguarding Children Boards</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Each local authority is required to set up an LSCB to bring key agencies such as police, probation, youth justice, heath, education and social care together to make sure local safeguarding of children is effective.

 The Learning and Skills Development Agency (LSDA) was a body funded by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) that supported organisations delivering post-16 education and training through research and training; it did not have NDPB status. It was the new name for the Further Education Development Agency. It was part of the new learning and skills sector established in April 2001. (For further information see "Making it Work". LSDA, 2001). 
 Plans for the agency were first announced at LSDA in June 2004, Press Notice 2004/0117. In April 2006 the strategy part of LSDA became the Quality Improvement Agency (QIA) for Lifelong Learning and the delivery part became Learning and Skills Network. QIA has since become part of the Learning and Skills Improvement Service.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">LSE</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">London School of Economics</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">LSEB</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">London Skills and Employment Board</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Responsible for delivering a long-term strategy for adult skills and employment in London.

 The London Skills and Employment Board (LSEB) was set up and first met in December 2006. It was created following a Government consultation on extending the Mayors powers in a number of areas, including skills. It is chaired by the Mayor of London and comprises major London employers to ensure that its work is driven by the needs of employers and that skills provision meets the existing and future needs of the London workforce.
 The Board is responsible for developing a long-term skills and employment strategy for London, based on research and evidence, focusing on improving skills of all Londoners and on identifying ways of tackling worklessness. 
 Its primary responsibility is for the strategic direction of the adult skills budget in London (approximately 560m per year). In addition, it seeks to influence the spending and priorities of other key agencies such as Jobcentre Plus, London Development Agency and the Higher Education Funding Council for England. The Board works within the framework of the National Skills Strategy and is accountable to the Secretary of State.
 Ambition
 The Boards ambition is to create the most successful and globally competitive labour market, that meets the current and future needs of both employers and Londoners, by:
 Supporting and promoting a thriving London economy
 Encouraging social and economic inclusion and cohesion

 The Learning and Skills Network (LSN) is an independent not-for-profit organisation committed to making a difference to education and training.
 History 
 LSN is one of the two successor organisations to the Learning and Skills Development Agency, taking forward LSDA's training, consultancy, research and service delivery activities. Launched in April 2006, LSN build on over 25 years of work with the sector through their predecessor organisations. 
 In 1995 two organisations merged, the Further Education Unit a development agency that tackled curriculum issues and the Staff College, which acted to develop the staff of the FE sector. This new organisation, the Further Education Development Agency (FEDA), brought these two areas together to ensure mutual support for these activities. 
 FEDA was renamed the Learning and Skills Development Agency in November 2000 to reflect its widening remit across the learning and skills sector. LSDA's programmes, research, training and consultancy continue under the banner of the Learning and Skills Network (LSN). LSDA's policy and strategic work has developed into the Quality Improvement Agency for Lifelong Learning (QIA). QIA has since become part of the Learning and Skills Improvement Service: www.lsis.org.uk/LSISHome.aspx
 Work of the LSN 
 LSN deliver quality improvement and staff development programmes that support specific government initiatives, through research, training and consultancy; and supply services directly to schools, colleges and training organisations. 
 LSN provides services to policy-makers, to organisations that fund, manage and provide education, and to individual providers and practitioners across education and training. These services fall into three broad categories: 
 Programmes
 Their programmes support learning providers their leaders, managers, teachers and trainers, to meet the challenges they face as the skills sector grows and develops. Funded by QIA, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Skills Funding Agency among others, each programme is designed to support a particular priority. For example, the Support for Success programme works within our sector to improve quality as a part of Success for All, the government's long-term programme of investment and reform for the learning and skills sector. 
 Research
 LSN's research and evaluation team focuses its work on sector priorities, including planning and funding, widening participation, technology and learning, and major programme evaluation. Research supports policy-makers at a national or regional level by providing evidence about what works, and aids practitioners by highlighting and disseminating good practice. 
 Training and consultancy
 Most services from LSN are funded by government agencies and delivered free. LSN have developed a range of training and consultancy solutions, e.g. implementing RARPA, support for partnership working, and support for implementing the Disability Equality Duty amongst many others.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">LSO</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Life Sciences Organisation</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DIT Team</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">BEIS</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">UK Vaccines Taskforce</td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">LSP</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Local strategic partnerships</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Non-statutory, multi-agency partnerships which match local authority boundaries.

 Following the UKs departure from the European Union, the UK NARIC recognition agency function has to change from a NARIC (which is an EU-only title) to an ENIC (the wider European title for national recognition agencies) in order to meet the UK's continuing treaty obligations under the Lisbon Recognition Convention.

 The guidance document Assessing the Net Capacity of Schools is available from DfE publications. The document describes the net capacity assessment method, which replaces all previous methods of assessing the capacity of maintained mainstream schools in England. The guidance explains why the new method has been introduced, how it works, and what needs to be measured. It also gives examples of completed net capacity assessment forms for both primary and secondary schools and answers some frequently asked questions. 
 Indicated Admissions Limit
 Dividing the NCA by the number of year groups and rounding down gives the Indicated Admissions Limit (IAL). Comparing the NCA with the Number on Roll (NOR - the number of children in the school at a specific time) can indicate the number of places that are surplus or the number of additional places that are needed in a school.

 The National Council for Educational Excellence was established by Gordon Brown in June 2007, with a role to bring together senior leaders from the education, HE and business sectors to promote educational excellence. 
 In early autumn 2008, the NCEE made recommendations (and agreed implementation plans) about improving links between employers and education - including a 'National Framework' which set out the four areas where business can make most difference (leadership and governance; basic skills; science, technology, engineering and maths; enterprise and employability) and the need for 'brilliant brokerage'.
 They also recommended:
 improving links between HE institutions and schools and colleges - including about areas where HE-school/college links could raise attainment, and about measures to raise aspirations and widen participation in HE.
 improving partnerships between education providers themselves - crucially, that high-performing institutions should expect to play a wider role in supporting others, and that more work should be done to be clear about expectations and accountability, and also about improving links between maintained and independent schools.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">NCER</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">National Consortium for Examination Results</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">NCER is a not-for-profit Community Interest Company mutually owned by all top-tier local authorities in England.

 Our aims
 The aims of the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics (NCETM) are to raise levels of achievement in maths, and to increase appreciation of the power and wonder of maths, across the school, sixth form college and further education system.
 In this context, our specific task is to try to ensure that all teachers of maths - and this includes all primary school teachers, and non-specialist maths teachers - have easy access to high quality, evidence-based, maths-specific continuing professional development (CPD) at every point of their careers.
 The main channel of our support for teachers and schools is the Maths Hubs programme, which we lead and coordinate. In our interaction with primary schools and primary teachers, the majority of our support comes through the various strands of the Teaching for Mastery programme.

In recent years the scope of the conference had expanded to encompass the broader childrens services agenda.
 Despite the conference name, delegates attended from across the UK and beyond. In recent years the conference took place outside of the North of England, including Belfast and Cardiff. In 2015 the conference was to be hosted in Manchester between 1416 January but was cancelled and has not been held since.

 seek out national and local communities of interest likely to benefit from rolling out the FIPs approach
 identify opportunities to use the FIPs approach to improve value for money, as well as improving outcomes for children and families
 receive reports on progress, including case studies and problem solving, in relation to the national roll-out of FIPs
 help disseminate good practice from FIPs

 The National Occupational Standards Board (NOSB) replaced the Project and Standards Approval Group (PSAG) and met for the first time on 1 May 2003. The Boards primary role is to ensure that National Occupational Standards are world-class statements of the skills knowledge and understanding needed in employment. It oversees and supports the development of National Occupational Standards across the UK and has introduced a new strategic approach to funding national occupational standards through an annual bidding process.
 Funds for national occupational standards development are collected quarterly from awarding bodies on the basis of a 10 levy on each Scottish and National Vocational Qualification certificate issued. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) and the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) provide staff and administrative support to the NOS Board to enable operation of the funding allocation process. However, the decisions reached on funding are made on behalf of the NOS Board and are not decisions of either the QCA or the SQA.

The association is led by serving headteachers. It does not concern itself with legal or pay issues (it does not seek to be a union). It is intended to create links between serving heads to best represent their professional concerns. 
 History
 The Association came about through groupings of primary headteachers united by concerns about the funding of their schools who came together to give evidence to the House of Commons Education Select Committee.
 The move was welcomed by Edward Simpson, former deputy secretary at the Department for Education and Employment who said "Here is a voice speaking out clearly in the interests of primary education which has hither been lacking and badly missed. this could be the most important outcome of all from the select committees years work."

The scheme will ensure that the necessary infrastructure and resources are available to all schools and education settings that want them. It was introduced on 30 December 2008 and has funding until March 2011.
 The Programme, run by the Mentoring and Befriending Foundation, will work across England, to enable young people to provide support and advice to one another in schools and build friendships. The programme will work in schools and colleges and involve young people being trained to mentor their peers, listen to their problems and engage other young people in the community. 
 As part of the National Peer Mentoring Programme, children and young people will:
 work with groups or individuals to resolve disputes through conflict resolution; 
 develop befriending schemes which help to encourage friendships for those children who might otherwise struggle to fit in or to be accepted;
 be trained to listen to problems and support their peers. 
 The Programme delivers a key commitment of the Aiming high for young people strategy to work with young people who have become disengaged with their community. By offering a young mentor to advice and support those young people experiencing difficult circumstances at school or at home, they can help make the transition to adulthood much easier. 
 Pilot scheme
 The Programme follows a successful pilot scheme which involved 180 schools and engaged with 3,600 pupils. The pilots focused on attainment, behaviour, bullying and transition. 
 The national programme will build on the pilots and is designed to apply to all young people in pre and post 16 education. Typically the young person requiring mentoring may be experiencing difficulties in education that are linked to language or social and communication skills.

 The National Qualifications Framework (NQF) is a list of qualifications that have been accredited by the QCA. Qualifications are organised into three categories - general, vocational and occupational - and assigned to one of six levels (according to degree of knowledge, skills and understanding, autonomy, analysis and creative thinking within the qualification). 
 
 Credit framework
 
 The credit framework is a set of minimum terms for valuing, measuring, describing and comparing achievement within the NQF and beyond. It builds upon the existing credit systems in England, creating a national framework. It will make sure that all forms of achievement are consistently recognised and rewarded. Credits given for achievement will be flexible so that they can be built up and transferred towards other qualifications or goals. The credit framework will also help learners to understand the value of their achievement and to play a part in planning their learning.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">NQT</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Newly qualified teachers</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">NRA</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">National Record of Achievement</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Began in 1991 replaced from 2004 by 'Progress File'.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">NRAG</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">National Rates Advisory Group</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">NRDC</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">National Research and Development Centre for adult literacy and numeracy</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">The National Research and Development Centre for adult literacy, language and numeracy (NRDC) was established by the UK government in 2002 as part of its Skills for Life strategy that aimed to improve the literacy, numeracy and language skills of adults in England.

 The Programme aims to:
 Ensure more children receive a healthy breakfast at the start of their school day; 
 Improve educational outcomes for disadvantaged young people;
 Share best practices across schools and encourage innovative approaches to school breakfast provision.
 From Spring 2020, a revised programme will be offered to up to 650 schools not already benefiting from the NSBP, within key disadvantaged communities, including the Department for Educations 12 opportunity areas. Schools will be offered customised support according to their situation and needs, including start up grants and deliveries of healthy food to ensure every child who needs a breakfast receives one.

The expansion began with the West Midlands in summer term 2002, followed by London in the autumn term, the North West in spring 2003 and the East Midlands in summer 2003. The North East started receiving fruit in March 2004 with the remaining four regions (South East, Yorkshire & Humber, South West and East of England) all coming on stream in autumn 2004. Participation by schools is on a voluntary basis but the scheme is available to all.
 On 1 April 2010 Primary Care Trusts became responsible for the financing the School Fruit and Vegetable Scheme for their area. The Department of Health will continue to negotiate and manage the Service Level Agreement (SLA), on behalf of PCTs, with NHS Supply Chain for England. PCTs will contribute to the scheme in proportion to their overall allocations. The transfer of financial responsibility to PCT allocations is in line with the Department of Healths broad policy for local decision-making and accountability for resources to meet local health and well-being needs. In the light of the current developing work on the Public Health Service ring-fenced budget from 2012/13, Department of Health Ministers will decide on whether the SF&VS should form part of this new system.

NTOs were the representative bodies for vocational training and educational matters, and had the main responsibility for developing national occupational standards and working with awarding and accrediting bodies to develop and implement National and Scottish Vocational Qualifications. 
 
 NTOs were employer-led, and represented employer and occupational groups. Unlike the majority of NTOs which represented sectors of employment, all-sector NTOs represented occupational groups which are found throughout the different sectors of industry.

 The sponsors meet termly to:
 ensure that the Panel is well briefed about sponsors' research programmes on a coherent basis 
 coordinate their responses to suggestions from the Panel 
 provide information and advice 
 mobilise their own networks and systems to further the Panel's work.
 Administrative support for the Panel's work is based at the DfE. Whilst maintaining close links with its sponsors, the Panel retains a high degree of autonomy and is not representative of its sponsors. 
 The Panel has around 15 members, all of whom are practising teachers who are recruited via a challenging process for their expertise in teaching, research and relating the two. Panel members usually serve for three years and roughly one third of members rotate on and off the Panel each year.

 The National Voluntary Youth Organisation (NVYO) Grant scheme is a three year cycle of funding (for the period of April 2005 - March 2008) which enables National Voluntary Youth Organisations (NVYOs) to promote the personal and social education of young people. The scheme is focused on two ministerial objectives: tackling social exclusion through priority groups and raising the standards and quality of youth work. 
 
 Although the funding is no longer available, national voluntary organisations will be able to bid for funding through the new Children, Young People and Families Grant, which will provide funding to the voluntary sector from April 2006. This national grant programme will fund voluntary organisations to do work of national significance that supports the outcomes of the Every Child Matters: Change for Children programme.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">NWD</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Non-Working Day</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">BEIS</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">UK Vaccines Taskforce</td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">NYA</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">National Youth Agency</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Founded in 1991.

 The OGC reports to the Chief Secretary of the Treasury. It has a supervisory board chaired by the Chief Secretary, and made up of Permanent Secretaries, including the Chief Executive of OGC, the Head of the National Audit Office, and senior external representatives.

They were a full-time two-year course, mainly for 16-18 year olds; it is the equivalent of 3 A Levels. 
 
 After the Haselgrave Report, the Business Education Council (BEC) and Technician Education Council (TEC) took over the accrediting of this qualification (called the "Ordinary National Diploma") and others in the stable, such as the National Certificate, Higher National Certificate and Higher National Diploma. The portfolio of courses was integrated when the BEC and TEC merged to form BTEC.

 People qualified as a teacher overseas and outside the European Economic Area (EEA), may be eligible to work in England as a temporary teacher without Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) for up to four years. This programme is currently available in England only. 
 Once they have found a teaching position in a school, the Overseas Trained Teacher Programme (OTTP) will provide them with their own individual training and assessment programme which will ultimately lead to a qualification to teach in England permanently.
 Minimum qualifications
 Potential candidates must first be qualified as a teacher overseas and working as an unqualified teacher in a school in England.
 In addition, if they qualified outside the EEA they will need:
 a qualification equivalent to a UK bachelors degree 
 a qualification equivalent to GCSE grade C or above in mathematics and English, and 
 if they intend to teach primary or key stage 2/3 (ages 7-14), they must also have achieved a standard equivalent to a grade C in a GCSE science subject.

 Ministers gave the go-ahead to PCP funding from April 2009 on 12 November 2008. More than 1500 primary school building projects got the go-ahead after the Government approved building plans worth 3.55billion.

 Information below from The Knowledge accessed 2019-04-15 [source referenced is Kent County Council website]
 A Personal Education Plan (PEP) is a document describing a course of action to help a child or young person being looked after reach their full academic and life potential. The first PEP should be agreed within 20 days of the child becoming looked after or joining a school.
 
 The PEP should be put together and be completed at a meeting in which the designated teacher, social worker and carers for the young person in public care are present. The child or young person should also be part of their education planning, either at the PEP meeting itself or through discussions outside that meeting.
 
 The PEP is intended as the overarching education plan, which is in turn an integral part of a child's Care Plan. A current PEP should always be available for review as part of the Care Plan. Departmental guidance stipulates that plans should be reviewed every six months. It is essential that a PEP meeting is held at any time of significant change; for example planning for examinations, transition or change of school, or at times of exclusion etc.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">Perm Sec</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Permanent Secretary </td><td class="govuk-table__cell">The civil service head of the department</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">PERN</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Parents in Education Research Network</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Parents in Education Research Network (PERN) is a network of individuals and organisations concerned with the promotion, dissemination and application of research and its applications about the roles, functions, participation and effects of parents, families and carers in the education of children - in the home, in the school, in the community and more widely.

 Additional information below from The Knowledge accessed 2019-04-16
 A Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) is a course providing graduates with a route into teaching. A PGCE course focuses primarily on the development of teaching skills, and not on the subject prospective teachers intend to teach. A PGCE course generally last for one year full-time or up to two years part-time.
 Bursaries
 From 2007 there is funding available for extended postgraduate mathematics and science courses. These courses are aimed at people who want to teach mathematics or science but need some additional subject knowledge training. Courses will begin during the 2007/08 academic year and will last between 18 months and 2 years. 
 In addition candidates may be eligible to receive taxable 'golden hello' payments (or teaching grants in Wales) worth between 2,500 and 5,000, depending on the subject, after successfully completing their induction period as a Newly Qualified Teacher (NQT). 
 Courses
 PGCE courses are available at universities and colleges throughout the UK. It may also be possible to study for a PGCE via flexible distance learning, or in a school by completing a programme of school centred initial teacher training (SCITT). 
 Applications
 The majority of PGCE applications are made through the Graduate Teacher Training Registry (GTTR). However, some ITT providers require that candidates approach them directly.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row"

 The Parent Know How Innovation Fund has created the three pilot projects. These latest additions to these services will launch in January 2010 and will join a range of other telephone helpline and innovative services available to mums, dads, carers and grandparents to ensure that wherever they look for information, they receive coherent advice from respected sources.
 
 The new pilots which ran until March 2011 were: 
 
 beGrand.net - A web-service to give grandparents a voice, support the development of grandparent communities, increase support for grandparents caring for children, increase contact between grandchildren and grandparents and improve grandparents' parenting skills.
 
 Parenting On Demand - Aims to develop and syndicate online videos designed to support parents/carers of children aged 5-19. The service creates a range of short video clips which provides information and advice on a range of topics including learning, behaviour and wellbeing. The videos also refers to other sources and services. 
 
 Relate for Parents - A relationship support service from Relate. It aims to develop online media tools to cater for parents needs by providing advice, support, and guidance to enable them to understand and improve their family relationships, manage conflict and make change happen.

Children attend every morning for two and half terms, returning to their home school for afternoon sessions. It aims to provide intensive learning support, raise self-esteem and develop positive learning behaviour. Each unit is for a maximum of 10 children.
 The PLSUs are for:
 -Children who are not working to their full potential, yet have the cognitive ability to achieve at least Level 4.
 -Children must be working at a minimum of National Curriculum Level 3c.
 -Children who may display negative learning behaviour, manifesting itself disruptively or by withdrawal.
 
 Unlike the Pupil Referral Unit, it is not the function of the PLSU to work with those children whose behaviour is so disruptive that it prevents learning from taking place.
 Content
 Sessions include:
 -Regular setting and reviewing of individual targets, encouraging the children to become independent and reflective learners.
 -Intense literacy and numeracy sessions to secure knowledge and key skills needed for SATs.
 -Using ICT as a tool to motivate and stimulate children's interest.
 -Circle time sessions to raise self esteem and promote positive behaviour management.
 -Understanding that we all learn in different ways and becoming aware of how we learn best.

 The aims of the organisation at first were two-fold: mutual support for those running groups and also the lobbying of government to emphasise the importance of pre-school provision and to seek the withdrawal of Circular 8/60 which prevented state nursery expansion.
 
 As a result of the need to demonstrate the educational value that playgroups offer to young children, the charity's members voted for a formal change of name to Pre-school Learning Alliance in
 1995 and also adopted a new corporate logo.

 The Princess Royal Trust for Carers is the largest provider of comprehensive carers support services in the UK. Through its network of 141 independently managed Carers' Centres, 83 young carers services and interactive websites, The Trust currently provides quality information, advice and support services to almost 310,000 carers, including over 15,500 young carers.
 
 In addition, The Trust also acts independently in the interests of carers through:
 
 Research, development and consultation
 Influence on national, regional and local policy
 Partnerships with other national organisations
 Information through our interactive websites, providing advice and access to support groups

 Pastoral Support Programmes (PSP) were introduced by the Department for Education and Skills in Circular 10/99 to Local Authorities to provide additional help to pupils at risk of permanent exclusion from school. 
 A PSP is an intervention determined by the school to help to improve a pupil's behaviour. A PSP should automatically be set up for a pupil who has been excluded several times from school for fixed periods, though a PSP can be set up for any pupil the school identifies as at risk of failure at school because of disaffection.
 A PSP should identify precise and realistic behavioural outcomes for the child to work towards. A nominated member of staff should oversee the PSP. It should be agreed with parents, who should be regularly informed about their child's progress.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">PSR</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Public Sector Resourcing</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">PSRE</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Public Sector Research Establishment</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-04-15</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">PSREF</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Public Sector Research Exploitation Fund</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-04-15</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">PST</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Provider Support Team</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">PSTT</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Primary Science Teaching Trust</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">PT</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Performance tables</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">PTA</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Parent teacher associations</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">PTDU (departmental organisational unit)</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Performance Tables Development Unit</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Year(s) active (where known): ?

 At the end of May 2010, the new Government announced its intention to close QCDA as part of its wider reform of education. The Department for Education (DfE) issued a revised remit letter to QCDA outlining their role until March 2011.
 
 QCDAs key priorities between September 2010 and the end of March 2011 were: 
 preparing the closure of QCDA, working with the DfE and other bodies to ensure the appropriate transfer of functions 
 delivering continuing work. 
 Legislation was required in order to abolish QCDA. QCDA was closed in March 2012.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">QCF</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Qualifications and Credit Framework</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Ofqual regulate qualifications that use the rules of the Qualifications and Credit Framework (QCF).

 The Quality Improvement Agency (QIA) was a Non-Departmental Public Body sponsored by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills and the successor to the Learning and Skills Development Agency (LSDA). The QIA were a charity with a board of trustees. They were established on 5 April 2006.
 The QIA was set up in line with the Department for Education and Skills' Five Year Strategy to create a clearer focus on quality improvement in the learning and skills sector. The Strategy set out a vision for the sector that, by 2008, it would be fully responsive to learners and employers, attract strong and effective staff and leaders, and would be responsible for its own self-improvement. 
 Responsibilities 
 To:
 accelerate improvement in the performance of the learning and skills sector 
 build the sectors capacity for self-improvement 
 help the sector respond to strategic reforms 
 lead the sector quality improvement strategy
 
 The Quality Improvement Agency (QIA) joined up with the Centre for Excellence in Leadership in October 2008 and is now called The Learning and Skills Improvement Service.

 The primary purpose of the RAE 2008 was to produce quality profiles for each submission of research activity made by institutions. The four higher education funding bodies intend to use the quality profiles to determine their grant for research to the institutions which they fund with effect from 2009-10. Any HEI in the UK that is eligible to receive research funding from one of these bodies was eligible to participate.

 As well as seeking support for further research projects RISE is working on its information centre, an online catalogue of official on-line education data. This is intended to prove a valuable resource to researchers, information officers and journalists as well as parents, teachers and governors. 
 RISE reports have covered many issues of particular interest to parents e.g. class size, school reports, home-school agreements, parental involvement in Ofsted inspections, school complaints procedures, school admissions and the role of parent governor representatives.

The approach is significantly different to the approaches used in England in a number of regards:
 Use of realistic situations as a means of developing pupils mathematics as opposed to using contexts as an introduction to mathematics or as an application of mathematics. 
 Less emphasis on algorithms and more on sense making and gradual refinement of informal procedures. 
 Emphasis on refining and systematising understanding. 
 Less emphasis on linking single lessons to direct content acquisition and more on gradual development over a longer period of time. 
 Greater emphasis on research into learning and teaching and of trialling and refining materials in schools.
 Use of guided reinvention rather than discovery learning or teachers explaining.
 Internationally RME is recognised as a very effective approach to teaching mathematics content (TIMSS 2003) and mathematical problem solving (PISA 2001).

Notable members have included Benjamin Franklin, Karl Marx, Adam Smith, William Hogarth, Charles Dickens, Guglielmo Marconi and John Diefenbaker.
 Notwithstanding its establishment credentials, the RSA has always been a radical body which has sought to challenge the status quo and change the world around it "to remove the barriers to social progress". Its founders spoke of the need to "embolden enterprise, enlarge science, refine art, improve our manufactures and extend our commerce", but also of the need to alleviate poverty and secure full employment.

 In the Skills Strategy White Paper (2003), the Government outlined the need for stronger partnerships between those who deliver services (regionally and locally) relating to adult skills and training, business support, employment and productivity. 
 These are Regional Skills Partnerships (RSPs). RSPs are forums where businesses and skills organisations work together to meet the skills needs of regional economies. They set out how the delivery of adult skills, workforce development, business support and labour market services can provide the best support for Regional Economic Strategies. 
 The core members of RSPs are the Regional Development Agencies, the Skills for Business Network, the Learning and Skills Council, the Small Business Service and Jobcentre Plus. (There may also be other members, decided on a regional basis) 
 The 2005 Skills White Paper reinforced the Government's commitment to RSPs and set out important new areas of responsibility for them in delivering the skills Strategy. These new areas included: 
 the National Employer Training Programme, 
 Brokerage and Business Support, 
 supporting 14-19 reform, 
 engagement with HE and links with Local Authorities.
 Reporting
 RSP Managers, working with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills have developed a reporting framework which provides evidence of the achievements and added value of the Partnerships. The reporting framework consists of three elements: 
 A set of skills-related indicators which together form an index that acts as a proxy for the overall performance of skills in the region.
 A six-monthly narrative report from RSPs which outlines their key outcomes and achievements during the reporting period and sets out priority actions and expected outcomes for the next six-months. 
 Six-monthly meetings with Ministers - the narrative reports are used to provide reports to Ministers and to other national partners. 
 History
 Regional Skills Partnerships built on the Frameworks for Regional Employment and Skills Action (FRESAs) that brought together demand and supply side agencies to identify the skills and employment priorities in each region. The RSPs developed this further by integrating the work of the key funding and planning agencies in the regions and providing services to meet the needs of employers and individuals.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">RSS</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Regional Skills Services</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Formerly the Regional Employer Skills Service.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">RSSS</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Review of School Staffing Structure</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-04-12</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">RSTW</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Raising Standards and Tackling Workload</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">The National Agreement on Raising Standards and Tackling Workload is designed to enhance the status of all staff who work in schools and to enable teachers to focus more on teaching and learning, by freeing them from routinely completing administrative tasks.

It achieved this, and over the three years that the scheme was in operation, nearly 13,800 schools won awards. Round three was the last round of the scheme.
 How the awards worked 
 In round three, the award-winning schools were selected in one of three ways: 
 For the great majority of schools, awards have been based on Key Stage tests/tasks or GCSE/GNVQ results. For rapid improvement awards schools were divided into Key Stage groups and ranked by the difference between their average points score in 1999 and 2002. 
 Awards were given to the highest-ranking schools in each group. High performance awards were based on comparing schools results in a single year, schools were subdivided into Autumn Package benchmark groups based on the proportion of pupils known to be eligible for free school meals and ranked by their average points score in 2002. Awards were given to the highest-ranking schools in each band. 
 For schools without test or exam results (Nursery schools), or where aggregated results do not provide sufficiently reliable performance indicators (Special schools, Pupil Referral Units, primary schools with 10 or fewer pupils in the relevant year group), awards were based on nominations by chief education officers or heads against specified standards. These nominations were assessed by panels with expert knowledge of the particular type of school. 
 Every school leaving special measures in the 2001/2002 school year has also received an award.
 Round three (May 2003) 
 School achievement awards were made for the third time in 2003. Awards were given to schools where pupils' results in 2002 were substantially better than in 1999 or where results in 2002 were better than most schools in similar circumstances in that year. They were intended to reward staff teams at award-winning schools and to encourage further progress. Both teachers and support staff were eligible for bonuses funded by an award. With advice from the head, governing bodies decided how to share an award between staff.
 The names of award-winning schools in round three were announced on 7 May. About 7,000 schools won awards, equivalent to 30% of eligible schools in England. About 60 million was distributed to award-winning schools through the Standards Fund in mid-May. A typical primary school received about 5,700 and a typical secondary school about 25,700. 
 About three quarters of awards were based on rapid improvement. Most of the rest were for good results compared with other schools in similar circumstances.
 Closure of the scheme 
 The scheme was closed as it achieved what it set out to do. The landscape had also changed since the scheme was introduced with far fewer failing schools and many more high achievers standards are getting better year on year. 
 In addition, the scheme evaluation showed that there was no real evidence to suggest that the scheme had a positive impact on teaching and learning, and school improvement.
 Funding 60 million per year - for the scheme was approved as part of Spending Review 2000 to support the annual allocation of funds in 2001, 2002 and 2003. No dedicated funds were available beyond 2003 and Ministers concluded that it would not be appropriate to divert further funds for additional years of the Scheme.

In that financial year the capital budget was 683 million, and this has since increased to over 3.8 billion in 2003-04. There are further increases to 4.5 billion in 2004-05 and 5.1 billion in 2005-06, making a total of 13.4 billion over the three years covered by the most recent spending review. This means that capital investment will be running at a higher level, in real terms, than at any time in the past half century.
 Approach to funding 
 The majority of capital funding is currently allocated on a formulaic basis to schools and Local Authorities (LAs) so that they can decide how to target these rapidly increasing resources to address their highest priority needs in line with local asset management planning processes. These processes give LAs a clear and systematic view of the needs of their schools, based on surveys of all school buildings. Authorities should prioritise these needs in a rigorous, consultative and transparent way so that their schools understand how they are prioritised relative to others. With the certainty of guaranteed long term funding, which is now over three years, LAs are encouraged to take a long term approach to improving school buildings rather than short term piecemeal changes or improvements which may not be cost effective.
 However, as a result of the large increase in investment secured as part of the 2002 Spending Review, it has been decided to introduce the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) initiative from 2005-06, when 2.2 billion will be made available. This is a programme of rebuilding and renewal to ensure that all secondary education has facilities of 21st century standard. The aim of this programme will be to deliver this goal successfully for every secondary pupil within 10-15 years (subject to future public funding decisions.) However, in the early phases, funding will (in the vast majority of cases) be targeted at the most deprived areas, where educational standards mostly need to be raised; although this will be on the basis that the relevant LAs can demonstrate that they have the capacity to deliver.

 Additional information below from The Knowledge accessed 2019-05-30
 A Serious Case Review (SCR) is undertaken by law by Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs) whenever a child dies or is seriously injured and abuse or neglect is known or suspected to be a factor.
 
 The Department for Children, Schools and Families launched a consultation on 31 July 2009 on guidance on SCRs in order to improve their quality, consistency and impact. This followed a number of recommendations made by Lord Laming in his progress report to strengthen and clarify the SCR process. His recommendations were accepted in full by Government with an undertaking to update statutory guidance set out in Chapter 8 of Working Together to Safeguard Children. The consultation was aimed at members of LSCBs and anyone who may play a part in a Serious Case Review and lasted for 12 weeks. 
 
 
 Changes proposed to the guidance include:
 
 Clearly setting out that the prime purpose for an SCR is to learn lessons both at an individual and inter-agency level;
 Emphasising the importance that SCRs are undertaken in a way that promotes learning and;
 Extending the suggested timescale for completing an SCR from four to six months, reflecting feedback from LSCBs and the inter-relationship between SCRs and other processes, such as criminal prosecutions or coroners inquests.

 School Direct (salaried) places
 These places are aimed mainly at graduates with 3 or more years work experience. However, schools can decide to accept applications from people with less work experience to attract high quality candidates in hard to fill subjects. Prospective candidates are expected to be career changers who can bring valuable skills and experience to the teaching profession. This experience does not have to be from an educational setting. For example, experience could have been gained in the financial, engineering or manufacturing sectors.
 Trainees are employed as an unqualified teacher. DfE provides funding to lead schools to cover training costs and subsidise the trainee salaries.

 Additional information below from The Knowledge accessed 2019-05-30
 A Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCO) is the teacher in a school with responsibility for the delivery of services for children with Special Educational Needs (SEN).
 Training
 Since September 2009 all new SENCOs are required to be both qualified teachers and receive additional training. The Department announced on 29 July 2008 that the Government would provide an extra 10 million a year to enable all new SENCOs to undertake nationally accredited training. Extra training will also be provided to trainee and existing teachers in a further 12m package.
 Undergraduate trainee teachers will benefit from new SEN and disability course materials, developed by the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA), and students will be provided with increased opportunities to experience placements in special schools or other specialist SEN units.
 Undergraduates training to be primary school teachers will benefit from new specialist units as part of their course, designed to give them additional skills to work with children with SEN. Equivalent units for secondary teachers were rolled out in 2009.
 For those teachers already in post, specially designed training materials will be made available to bolster their confidence in dealing with children with SEN starting with communication difficulties and dyslexia. The training will be delivered through the Inclusion Development Programme.

 The Secondary Heads Association (SHA) was formed in 1977 by the amalgamation of the AHM and the HMA. In 1983, SHA took a step forward when members overwhelmingly voted to admit deputy heads as full members, thus becoming the first association to recognise the specific role of the senior leadership team. With the growing recognition of and need for shared leadership responsibility, SHA opened membership to assistant heads in 1999 and to bursars and other senior support staff on the leadership team in 2005.
 By 2005, two-thirds of SHA members were in roles other than that of head. Therefore to better reflect the true makeup of the association, in January 2006, members voted to change the name to the Association of School and College Leaders.

It is one of the constituent organisations of the Independent Schools Council. It was previously called the Society of Headmasters and Headmistresses of Independent Schools hence the 'M' in its abbreviated form which is still retained.
 SHMIS was formed in 1961 when a group of Heads decided they needed a forum in which to share ideas and experience. Since then the Society has grown substantially in size, reputation and effectiveness. SHMIS now represents schools of all sizes throughout the country with a couple of valued overseas members. Many SHMIS schools have a boarding tradition; a number are at the leading edge of education in music, dance and the arts; and several are well-known for their effective support for those with learning difficulties.

 These new qualifications, backed by education experts, will provide recognition for those teachers who want to develop their skills and progress their careers.
 Our ambition is for teachers to be able to do so without having to pursue traditional leadership routes, instead expanding their expertise in vital areas such as curriculum or behaviour management.
 The expert panel draws on a range of experience from across the school system, including curriculum experts, current school leaders and leading academics. The group will play an essential role in helping to ensure all the qualifications are aligned in order to maximise the benefits for teachers.
 The professional qualifications will build on the landmark Early Career Framework, which is set to be backed by at least 130 million a year when fully rolled out. The framework is a two-year package of training and support at the start of a teachers career will include a reduced timetable to allow teachers to make the most of their training.

It aims to save up to 30 million annually if all schools in England sign up with huge savings in time; administration; and the cost of re-advertising posts in national and local media because recruits are better matched to jobs. At launch, 52 local authorities, representing over 8,000 schools, and 32 academies have already signed up to the service.

 Staying Safe was launched for consultation in July 2007, and during the consultation period, the Department spoke to parents, children and young people, members of the general public and practitioners about their concerns in relation to children's safety.
 
 The Action Plan set out the work which Government took forward over the next three years to drive improvements in children and young people's safety, which will be measured by the new PSA to improve children and young people's safety. 
 
 The Staying Safe Action Plan covers three main areas:
 
 1.Universal safeguarding, involving work to keep all children and young people safe and to create safe environments for them
 2.Targeted safeguarding to reduce the risks of harm for vulnerable groups of children and young people
 3.Responsive safeguarding, involving responding effectively when children are harmed 
 
 The Action Plan set out new commitments on children's safety, including a new Ã‚Â£18m home safety equipment scheme targeted at vulnerable areas, a Child Safety Education Coalition and a new National Safeguarding Unit for the Third Sector.
 
 Publication of new guidance

 New role in developing special schools as leaders
 
 Ed Balls announced on 28 September 2009 that the SSAT would be taking forward a 550,000 project to develop special schools as leaders in teaching and learning practice for children with the most complex learning difficulties, meeting a commitment in the 21st century schools system White Paper. 
 
 The White Paper: Your child, your schools, our future: building a 21st century schools system committed the Department to commission work on developing special schools as leaders in teaching and learning practice for children with the most complex needs which SSAT won following an open competition.
 
 History
 
 SSAT began life in 1992 as the Technology Colleges Trust when it launched a school affiliation scheme. It changed its name to the Specialist Schools Trust in 2003. It then became the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust on 29 September 2005 to reflect the Trusts new support role for the academies programme.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">SSC</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Sector skills councils</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">SSCL</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Shared Services Connected Limited</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Shared service for HR and Pay in DfE.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">SSDA</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Sector Skills Development Agency</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Set up in 2002.

These were School Certificate and Higher School Certificate. It was chaired by Rev William Temple with representatives of the examining bodies, the Teachers Registration Council, and local authority organisations.
 
 The Council produced a number of small reports on examinations and the Norwood report on curriculum and examinations.
 
 In 1964 its functions were transferred to the Schools Council.

 It was created to give a bigger voice to the more than 300,000 school support staff and to establish a separate negotiating forum for support staff pay and conditions, where the specific role they play is recognised and reflected fairly and openly across all schools. 
 Closure
 
 The SSSNB was effectively closed in October 2010 although the statutory closure happened at a later date.

 TIMMS collects data at international grades four and eight (Years 5 and 9 respectively in England). 
 Within each country:
 170 schools (including independent) from each grade(year) are randomly selected to participate
 Within each participating school 30 pupils are selected at random
 A separate questionnaire is also completed by the teacher and school (there is also a parent questionnaire but this is not administered in England)
 The study is conducted on a four-year cycle - TIMSS Cycles:
 1995 - 41 Countries
 1999 - 38 Countries
 2003 - 46 Countries
 2007 - 62 Countries
 2011 - 67 Countries
 2015 - 53 Countries
 The Department for Education sponsor TIMSS (and PIRLS) in England and represents the UK on the IEA's governing body. Northern Ireland and Scotland participate in the studies separately and their results are reported separately to England in the international report.
 TIMSS consists of specially developed tests in maths and science and background questionnaires which were completed by pupils, teachers and headteachers.

The programme provides opportunities for teachers in England to develop their teaching skills, by experiencing alternative practice in a number of key themes through short-term international study visits. Such visits also aim to create valuable international links between schools, facilitating international school partnerships and information sharing on a global level.
 The Programme provides 2580 places per year. Itis delivered by four providers: the British Council (BC), the League for the Exchange of Commonwealth Teachers (LECT), the HTI (HTI) and the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust (SSAT). Each Local Authority (LA) in England has its own allocation of places.
 
 Since the programme was launched, TIPD participants have visited countries across the world including Singapore, Australia, Hungary, China, Sweden and the USA to study themes such as ICT, special educational needs (SEN), citizenship and literacy.
 The Programme enables teachers to learn from, and contribute to, educational ideas and best practice in schools throughout the world, helping to support teachers in raising standards of teaching and learning both in England and abroad.
 The programme has a number of different strands with a range of opportunities available to teachers and LAs.
 It provides the opportunity to
 share good practice
 develop international educational links with other schools
 carry out research
 share information with a network of other participants
 reflect on own practice

 The strategy aims to
 Halve the rate of conceptions to under-18s by 2010. 
 Increase the participation of teenage parents in education, training and employment. 
 TPIAG currently has 12 members, each with specific expertise in key areas. Members are appointed by the Minister for Children, Young People and Families, for fixed terms, following open competition, in accordance with the Nolan rules for NDPBs.
 The group meets on a quarterly basis, with additional sub-group meetings as needed. The chair and members have an ongoing dialogue with the relevant government departments, and regularly participate in meetings around the country, make presentations, visit projects and work with the media.
 TPIAG publishes annual reports, to which the Government makes a formal response. The last report was published in November 2009. The group also publishes occasional reports on specific topics and responds to Government consultations.

 The Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) is an executive agency of the Department for Education (DfE). The purpose of the agency is to take action on receipt of allegations of serious teacher misconduct and to support employers, schools and headteachers with safeguarding responsibilities. It provides employers with access to the database of qualified teachers (DQT) in order for them to complete pre-recruitment checks to ensure that they are employing teachers who are not prohibited from teaching and who are appropriately qualified for their role. In addition, the agency acts on behalf of the Secretary of State as the Competent Authority for teaching in England. This role includes the recognition of the professional status of appropriately-qualified teachers from outside England and the award of qualified teacher status (QTS).

 Schools will benefit from a three-year programme of support, with each of the six successful schools acting as a regional hub and will receive funding to support between 200 to 300 other schools in the local area.
 This will give struggling schools direct access to the expertise from school leaders with a track record of improving challenging schools. Support could include delivering tailored professional development for teachers, hosting observations and visits or deploying system leaders to offer advice and guidance to local schools.
 This forms part of a new scheme, launched by the department last year, to simplify and strengthen how the government drives up school standards, building on the successes of the Teaching Schools and National Leaders of Education programmes.

 TSIA was piloted in 2006-07 and started fully in 2007-08 in and involves eight (rising to 12) schools from London. The partnership extended to the Black Country in the 2009-10 academic year and involves five schools with eight schools by summer 2010. Greater Manchester Challenge schools will join in January 2010 with 10 schools. The partnership closely mirrors many of the aims of City Challenge to raise standards and aspirations in these urban schools. There has been positive feedback from London schools that it is helping raise literacy levels by identifying, adapting and implementing successful ideas.
 The aims of the TSIA are:
 to focus on innovation;
 schools to drive their own development;
 to maximise the freedoms on schools and minimise bureaucracy;
 To identify and disseminate knowledge and skills.

 The Technical and Vocational Education Initiative (TVEI) which began as a national programme in 1987 and continued until 1997-98 helped equip young people with the knowledge and skills to succeed in adult and working life. It sought to relate the whole curriculum to the world of work, to promote work experience, to involve employers in school life and to help teachers gain and understanding of industry and commerce.
 It was managed by Government Offices (GOs) through contracts with Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs), Local Education Authority/local education authorities (LEAs) and others. TVEI funds (over 900m in total) supported targeted projects aimed at raising young people's levels of attainment. TVEI was extensively evaluated. The evidence showed that young people's career planning skills had been improved, that the programme had encouraged them to continue their learning post-16, and that personal, interpersonal and initiative skills had been enhanced.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">TVET</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Technical and Vocational Education and Training</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">TWES</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Training and Work Experience Scheme</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">TWIST (departmental organisational unit)</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Teacher Workload and Impact on Schools Team</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Year(s) active (where known): 2019</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">TYWDF</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Transforming Youth Work Development Fund</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">Transforming Youth Work Development Fund (TYWDF) was launched in 2002 with the intention of providing Local Authority youth services with additional funding to enhance the quality and capacity of youth work. This Fund has since become the Transforming Youth Work Performance Improvement Fund (TYWPIF).
 
 Aims of the fund
 
 10 million was pledged by Ministers for each of 2003-04, 2004-05 and 2005-06 for the youth work programme. The key aims of the TYWDF were to: 
 Support the implementation of Youth Service Plans
 Build capacity within the voluntary sector
 Introduce innovative and imaginative projects - particularly around cultural diversity, the promotion of Community Cohesion and the reduction of youth crime and anti-social behaviour
 Continue to bring youth services into closer engagement with Connexions 
 The TYWPIF carries forward the previous agenda but also asks for youth services to focus resources on work around achieving performance measures.

 Those young people were more likely than others of drifting out of learning and into long-term disaffection. The aim of the u-project was to aid the transition from secondary school to adult life, by providing a structured programme of challenging activity and high-quality advice and guidance to encourage participants to remain in education or to take up training or employment. Activities on the programme were designed to offer the young people personal challenges, an opportunity to reflect, and a sense of achievement.
Funding from the Big Lottery Fund ended in December 2004.

 However, Ufi contributes beyond the worlds of adult learning and workforce development, working across government departments on government e-services, digital inclusion, prison reform, financial literacy, citizenship and community regeneration. 
 
 
 Learndirect 
 
 Ufi launched Learndirect in October 2000. Since its launch, nearly 2 million learners have taken Learndirect courses in subjects ranging from the Skills for Life of literacy and numeracy to languages, management, English for Speakers of Other Languages and IT at all levels. Supported by staff in centres, or at home or work by online tutors, Learndirect learners can choose to work towards nationally recognised qualifications including the Certificates in Adult Literacy and Numeracy, CLAIT and the ECDL (European Computer Driving Licence). 
 
 Additionally, the Learndirect advice service has provided free, impartial careers guidance and advice on over a million learning opportunities to more than seven million callers, and more than 17 million information and advice sessions through its website.

 UK ENIC is the UK National Information Centre for the recognition and evaluation of international qualifications and skills.
 
 Following the UK's departure from the European Union, the UK NARIC recognition agency function has to change from a NARIC (which is an EU-only title) to an ENIC (the wider European title for national recognition agencies) in order to meet the UK's continuing treaty obligations under the Lisbon Recognition Convention. Therefore, on 1 March 2021, the UK NARIC agency title becomes UK ENIC, operated and managed by Ecctis Limited.

It is a longitudinal dataset which allows students' progress to be tracked. 
 YPMAD is generated by matching several data sources (school census, awarding organisation and individualised learner record data). 
 YPMAD is used to underpin the National Statistics output Level 2 and 3 attainment by young people aged 19, which is used to estimate the skill levels of the overall population at age 19. Unlike the figures in school performance tables, it is not used for accountability purposes so YPMAD allows for a longer and more consistent time-series.

The YRO will consolidate and enhance existing community sentences to enable courts to sentence in a flexible and tailored way. The YRO provides a range of sentencing options that will punish effectively and rehabilitate young people, including intensive fostering, intensive surveillance and supervision requirements, electronic monitoring, curfews, the required attendance of substance abuse or mental health programmes as well as undertaking tough community work and reparation. This could include apologising to their victim, in order to make visible amends for their crimes.</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">DFE</td><td class="govuk-table__cell"></td><tr class="govuk-table__row"><th scope="row" class="govuk-table__header">YSDA</th><td class="govuk-table__cell">Youth Sector Development Fund</td><td class="govuk-table__cell">The Youth Sector Development Fund (YSDF) has been set up to provide a direct response to the commitments in Aiming High for Young People/Aiming High for young people: a ten year strategy for positive activities to build the capacity of third sector organisations. The YSDF will support third sector organisations (TSOs) that can demonstrate effective approaches to engaging and empowering young people, particularly the most disadvantaged. From April 2008, up to 100 million will be available to provide a mixture of large and small grants and expert business support to help these organisations sustain and grow their provision so that more young people can benefit from the activities they offer. Grants totalling 27m have already been awarded through the YSDF to five organisations, Leap Confronting Conflict, Fairbridge, Kids Company, Speaking up and UK Youth who each help and support some of our most disadvantaged young people.

 Through the Young Volunteer Challenge pilot (YVC) a young person will have the opportunity to do some volunteering work after they leave school. The pilot is being run in 9 areas within England until September 2005, and offers opportunities for 820 young people for whom finance is the main barrier to participate in volunteering. This full-time initiative (full-time is defined as more than 30 hours per week) will target 18 and 19 year olds who have completed their programmes of post-16 learning with the support of an Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA), or were eligible for Income Support while undertaking vocational training. The age range will be extended to 21 years for young people with special needs or disabilities. Volunteers will receive a weekly allowance of 45, and an end of experience award of 750 after completing 9 months experience. The pilot will also seek to enhance the personal development of the volunteers in such areas as communication, personal planning, teamwork and leadership skills as well as their commitment to further learning, employment and volunteering.
